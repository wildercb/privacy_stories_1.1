Use the
trac.notification.model.Subscription
model class to access this table.
Note that this table does not store an (email) address, but the commonly used subscription tuple has an additional item
addr
. Usually such tuples that correspond to entries in this DB table contain a
addr
of
None
. Other tuples may contain an (email) address (e.g. retrieved from  a ticket CC field) but are missing the
sid
item instead.

Open Questions
Rename
class
column?
Something like
rule
might be more appropriate.
See also
INotificationSubscriber
.
Rename
distributor
column?
transport
might be more consistent.
Rename tables?
The current table names are taken from the
​
th:AnnouncerPlugin
.
Would this cause problems for users that already used that plugin?
DONE
Renamed
subscription

notify_subscription
.
DONE
Renamed

Remove
time

These are not really needed.
