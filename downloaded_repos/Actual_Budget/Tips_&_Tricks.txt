will show the budget
Cmd
2
will show reports
Cmd
3
will show all accounts

BUT here is one that WILL work in the web app as well:

Cmd
O
(O not zero) this will close the file and list other available files to open

Enter
while editing a budget amount will move to the next category.
Shift
Enter
will move to the previous category.

When editing,
Enter
and
Shift
Enter
will move down and up. If a dropdown is open and you've typed a new value, this will instead save the value and close the dropdown.
When editing,
Tab
and
Shift
Tab
will move left and right
When adding a new transaction,
Cmd
Enter
will add it regardless of where you are editing. Pressing

D
Delete selected transactions.
A
Set account for selected transactions.
P

View multiple months at once
​

In the top left of the budget, you will see this control:

This sets the maximum amount of months to render at once, and defaults to 1. If you want to view multiple months on the same page, click the boxes to increase the number.

This only controls the
maximum
number of months. If the app is too small to render all of them it will only render the months that fit on the screen.

Show running balances
​

A "running balance" is the balance of the account after every transaction over time. This is very useful for reconciling accounts with banks because you can see the balance at a specific date and use it to compare it with your bank.

To enable this:

Click on an account
Click on the 3 dots to show the actions menu
Select "Show running balance"

A new column should appear which shows the balance of the account after each transaction:
