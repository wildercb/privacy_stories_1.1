Backing up your Actual budget

If your budget is very old, you may have trouble restoring large backups. If you’re encountering this issue, click “Reset Sync” under 'Settings' > 'Show advanced settings' to reset sync, then make the export again. This should reduce the file size.

You can export your data from Actual at any time. To do so,

Login to your budget, click 'More' > 'Settings'
Scroll down to the Export section and click Export Data
Save the file somewhere on your computer - that is it done.
