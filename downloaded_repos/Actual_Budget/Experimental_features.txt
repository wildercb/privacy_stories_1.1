Budget Goal Templates

Budget Goal Templates

This is an
experimental feature
. That means we’re still working on finishing it. There may be bugs, missing functionality or incomplete documentation, and we may decide to remove the feature in a future release. If you have any feedback, please
open an issue
or post a message in the Discord.

All functionality described here may not be available in the latest stable release. Use the
edge
images for the latest implementation.

Create a template by adding a note to a category and adding a line that begins with
#template
.

You are welcome to have other lines in your note, but the #template line must match the syntax.

Available Templates
​

Currency symbol is optional,
#template $50
and
#template 50
are the same.
Number formats that use comma for the decimal separator are not supported (eg, 123,45). You must use 123.45.
Thousands separators are not supported (eg, 1,234). You must use 1234.
{SCHEDULE NAME} is defined in the
Schedules
editor.
Take great care to copy across these schedule names EXACTLY
, without braces.
By default templates do not consider available funds when being applied. Use template priorities to not budget more than is available.
The
hold
flag can be added to any goal that uses the
up to
key word.
A single category with two templates that use
up to
is not supported.
If in a category there are multiple templates within the same priority level and one template uses the
up to
key word, all templates in that priority level will be limited to the maximum amount specified by
up to
.

You can add multiple
#template
lines for a single category note. Each line will be added together.

For examples:

Budget $200/month for 3 months and $400/month for the next 3 months

Streaming Services: $42.97

$120 in February 2022, $130 in March 2025

Template Priorities
​

Templates can be given a priority flag to change the order that the templates get applied to your budget. Set a priority by adding
-X
to the
#template
flag. EX
#template-4
will be priority level 4. Any template with a priority other than 0 will not apply more funds then are available.

Lower priority values get run first. EX 0 is run first, then 1, then 2, etc.
No priority flag defaults to priority 0 and is the same as a standard template.
Negative priorities are not allowed and will result in the template being skipped.
Template application order is based on the database order, not the view order.  To guarantee a specific fill order use separate priorities for each category.
If you have multiple
schedule
or
by
template lines in a single category, they will be forced to match the same priority level as the line run first.
If the
up to
key words are used with a category that has multiple templates with different priorities, the lowest priority will take precedence because it is evaluated last as shown in the following examples.
It is recommended to use the "overwrite with budget template" option when applying templates if you use priorities.
Expected budgeted amount is 200
Expected maximum category balance is 200
#template 300
#template-1 150 up to 200
Expected budgeted amount is 450
No maximum category balance exists
#template 150 up to 500
#template-1 300

Lower priority values get run first. EX 0 is run first, then 1, then 2, etc.

No priority flag defaults to priority 0 and is the same as a standard template.

Negative priorities are not allowed and will result in the template being skipped.

Expected budgeted amount is 450
No maximum category balance exists
#template 150 up to 500
#template-1 300

Expected budgeted amount is 200
Expected maximum category balance is 200

Expected budgeted amount is 450
No maximum category balance exists

Remainder Template
​

The remainder template is run differently to the other templates. Any remainder templates will be forced to run last in their own pass. This way the remaining budget is after all other templates have had a chance to run. Below are a few considerations when using the remainder template

You can use as many remainder templates as you want
Remainder templates don't have a priority as they are always run last
The remainder template supports weights to control the distribution of funds across multiple categories. See the examples on how this is done.
If no weight is provided, the weight will be defaulted to 1
The budgeted amount is calculated as
budgeted_amount=available_funds/sum_of_weights*category_weight

All the examples below use the case of $100 leftover when the remainder pass is run.

Add all remaining funds to a single category

Split funds evenly between two categories

Split funds with one category receiving extra

Spread funds over many categories

Goal Directive
​

This option is unique enough to warrant its own directive
goal
instead of the standard
template
option.
The
goal
option overrides how the goal indicator typically functions.
In the standard templates, the goal indication colors are based on the current month's budgeted value.
When using the
goal
option, the indication is based on the total balance.
This shifts the indication to a long-term goal you are saving up to instead of just the current monthly portion.
A few examples have been given to illustrate this difference.

The
goal
templates are run the same way as the other templates but using the month options or the category budget options.
If there is a
goal
directive in a category, the indicator for that category will be based on the total balance compared to the amount set in the template line.
The
goal
directive will not budget any funds, and funds budgeted by hand will not get reset by running templates.
A
goal
line can be stacked with templates to automatically budget the category(via the templates) but override how the category goal is indicated(the goal line).
If templates are included with a
goal
, the budgeted amount will get overwritten when using the "overwrite with budget template" button.
There is no priority on a
goal
line.

All examples assume that $400 was carried over from the previous month

In this case, a balance greater than or equal to 500 will set the balance green, marking a met goal.
If you run the template, you get the following:

If you were able to budget 100 this month, you would then hit your goal and get a green indication.

In this example, a template is used to automatically budget 50 into the category when templates are run.
The goal line will override the goal indication from the
template
line, and only go green when a balance of 500 is reached.
If you run templates, you get the following:

If you have some extra funds after templates are run and can budget that last 50, you get the following:

Apply the templates
​

To apply the goal templates you create, enable the feature in the Settings experimental section. When the feature is on, three new options will appear in the monthly budget actions list.

Check templates
will test all template lines for proper syntax.

Apply budget template
will only fill empty cells using the templates.

Overwrite with budget template
will fill in all budget cells using the templates.

After having run the templates in a given month the status of a respective category goal will be indicated as a text color of the category balance.  The image below shows an example of categories in the following states: normal (no goal set), zero (no goal set), goal met, goal not met, and a negative balance.
