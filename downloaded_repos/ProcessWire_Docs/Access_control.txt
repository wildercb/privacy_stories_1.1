ProcessWire uses a role-based access control system (RBAC). Users are assigned to one or more roles, each role is assigned permissions, and roles are assigned to templates for access control of pages.
Roles
Roles are a way of grouping multiple users and assigning permissions to that group. They are the connection of both users and templates to permissions.

Roles and users
A user can have multiple roles, each with different permissions. Though for simple needs, it's common for a user to just have one non-guest role. However, you may assign as many roles to a user as you need, and the user will gain the access and permissions assigned to all of the roles they belong to.

Default roles
ProcessWire includes two permanent roles by default, though you may add as many roles as you like. The two roles included with every ProcessWire installation are:

guest
The guest role is automatically given to all anonymous site users. You should not give this role any access other than page-view permission.

superuser
The superuser role has all-inclusive access to the site without limitation. This role should only be given to the most trusted users that operate the site. Superuser has all permissions regardless of what you assign with the superuser role.

Custom roles
You can also add as many other roles as you want and selectively assign them to specific users. Each role can be assigned a unique set of permissions. Any given user can have multiple roles, and that user will inherit all permissions assigned to each of their roles. All users also inherit permissions assigned to the guest role.

Checking if a user has a role
To check if a user has a specific role from the API side, use the $user->hasRole('roleName') method:

if($user->hasRole('editor')) {
  // user has the editor role, display editor_notes field
  echo "<h3>Editor notes</h3>" . $page->editor_notes;
}
Roles and permissions
Roles are essentially a group of permissions that can be assigned to users. Users gain all the permissions assigned to all of their roles.

In some cases a permission doesn't do much until the role containing the permission is also assigned to a template (the context). A good example of this is the page-edit permission. If it were as simple as giving a role page-edit permission, then they would be able to edit any page anywhere in the site, which is usually not what you want. Instead, a permission like page-edit also requires a context, and templates (as used by pages) are that context. So a user might have a general page-edit permission via a role assigned to them, but they won't be able to actually edit any pages until a template also has that same role selected. This is how you can enable granular access (edit, view, create, add, delete, etc.) to some pages and not others.

Assigning permissions to roles
Assigning permissions to roles is as simple as editing the role in your admin at Access > Roles > your_role. Once there, you will see a long list of checkboxes representing the various permissions that you can assign to the role. In some cases (like page-edit permission), clicking a permission reveals numerous other permissions below it. This indicates that such permissions are child permissions of the one you checked, and thus only apply if the role has the parent permission. Though you don't need to think about that, as the role editor adjusts the visibility of permissions according to what is applicable.

Permissions with template context
Some permissions also support a template context. Meaning, the permission won't do much until the role having it is also assigned to a template. When this is the case, the role editor will show the permission along with a checkbox list of all templates where the permission can be assigned (which would be all templates that have access control enabled). If you don't see the template you need, you can enable access control for it (see roles and templates).

Editing permissions with template context in the role editor is convenient because it enables you to edit all permissions for the role, in the context of those access controlled templates, right on a single screen. You can also edit template/role assignments from the template editor (Setup > Template > your_template > Access), but in this case you are editing access for all roles on one template, rather than all templates on one role. It does not matter which one you use, but which is more convenient will depend on whether you've got more templates or more roles.

Roles and templates
Roles are assigned to users, but they are also assigned to templates that have access control enabled. As stated earlier, this is how you limit access (view, edit, create, add, etc.) to certain pages, or groups of pages, in your site. By default, access control is not enabled for a template. When not enabled, pages using the template inherit access from the closest parent page that has access control enabled.

Enabling template access control
You can enable access control for a template from the template editor Access tab (Setup > Templates > your_template > Access). From here you can dictate what roles are allowed to view, edit, create, add new pages, and more. Any role can be assigned for view permission, but only roles that have at least page-edit permission are assignable for edit/add/create access in these template access settings. Once a template has access control enabled, these can also be assigned in the role editor—see the section above on permissions with template context.

Permissions overview
What are permissions?
Permissions in ProcessWire are objects of type Permission (a type of Page object). They each represent permission to access something, or to perform some action. Each permission has a name, and most are self describing. For instance, the page-edit permission is the foundation of providing page editing access.

Permissions are assigned to Roles, and one or more Roles are assigned to each User. Users gain the permissions assigned to their Roles. In many cases permissions can also have a Page context, which is defined with the template used by the Page (Setup > Templates > [template] > Access [tab]). Meaning, the User may have a permission (like page-edit), but it doesn't become applicable to a particular Page unless enabled for the Template used by that Page.

How do you create a permission?
ProcessWire comes with several permissions that it recognizes (described on this page), but you can also create your own permissions and name them whatever you would like.

Permissions in ProcessWire are pages, and thus can be created like any other pages. But because they are a unique type of page, there is a path you should take to create them. Specifically, in your admin, go to Acess > Permissions > Add New. Enter the name of the permission you want to create in the "name" field, and describe the purpose of the permission in the "title" field.

You can also create permissions from the API:

$permission = $permissions->add('permission-name');
$permission->title = 'Description of what this permission does';
$permission->save();
After creating a permission, you can easily assign it to any Role from the admin (Access > Roles). In your site or application, you can easily check if the current user has that permission with a single API call, described in the next section.

How are permissions used from the API?
Whether from the core, a module, or the front-end of your site/application, most permission checking is performed from a single method call on the $user API variable:

if($user->hasPermission('permission-name')) {
  // user has this permission in one of their roles
} else {
  // user does not have this permission
}
To check if a user has a permission within the context of a particular page, simply add the $page as a second argument to the call:

if($user->hasPermission('permission-name', $page)) {
  // user has this permission, for this $page
}
A user may have multiple roles. As a result, when providing a $page context like the example above, ProcessWire confirms that the user has that permission in the same role that is defined with the template used by the given $page. Because context is specific to pages, context is primarily applicable to permissions that start with "page", like page-edit, page-view, page-create, page-sort, and so on.

Default core permissions
These permissions come pre-installed with every copy of ProcessWire.

page-add
Indicates whether a user has permission to add child pages to a given parent page. This is a symbolic runtime permission and thus does not exist in your list of permissions, but you may occasionally see reference to it. The permission becomes available only if a role already has page-edit permission, and "add" permission is specifically assigned to a role in the template access settings. Since this is a runtime-only permission, you should not attempt to create this permission.

page-create
Indicates whether a user has permission to create pages of a certain type (template). This is a symbolic runtime permission and thus does not exist in your list of permissions, but you may occasionally see reference to it. The permission becomes available only if a role already has page-edit permission, and "create" permission is specifically assigned to a role in the template access settings. Since this is a runtime-only permission, you should not attempt to create this permission.

page-delete
Enables a user to remove a page they have edit access to edit. For non-superusers, removing a page implies moving it to the trash. As a result, superusers can recover pages deleted by non-superusers. Also requires page-edit permission.

page-edit
Pre-requisite for having the ability to use the admin for listing or editing pages. A user with this permission (via one of their roles) does not actually have edit access to any pages until they also have edit access assigned at the template level (Access tab). You should enable this permission for any roles that you intend to have any kind of editing or admin access.

page-edit-front
This permission is available in ProcessWire 3.0 and newer and is installed by the PageFrontEdit core module. It enables editing of fields you designate on the front-end of your site. Non-superusers must have this permission in order to make edits on the front-end. Such users must also have page-edit permission. When this permission is assigned to a role, users with that role can make front-edit edits to any pages they already have edit access to edit. Alternatively, this permission can instead be assigned to a role on a per-template basis from the Access tab of a template edit screen, enabling you to provide front-end editing for some instances and not others. For more information on how to implement front-end editing, see our documentation on front-end editing.

page-lister
Enables a user to access the Page Lister. In a default ProcessWire installation, Lister is located at Pages > Find. This permission is also a pre-requisite for other page-lister permissions used by ListerPro.

page-lock
Enables user to lock or unlock a page. When a page is locked, no edits may be performed on it until the page is first unlocked. A page can be locked or unlocked from the page editor Settings tab > Status field, or directly in the Page List/Lister inline page actions. Also requires page-edit permission.

page-move
Enables user to change the parent of a page (if the page template family settings allow it to exist in another parent). Parent can be changed from the page editor Settings tab > Parent field, or from the inline drag-and-drop "move" action in Page List. Also requires page-edit permission.

page-sort
Enables user to change the sort order of child pages, or change the predefined sort order (if defined with the page). Note that this permission should be assigned on the page that has the children you want sortable, rather than on the child pages. Also requires page-edit permission.

page-template
Enables user to change the template used by a page. This is performed in the page editor Settings tab > Template field. Also requires page-edit permission.

page-view
Enables a user role to view pages. All roles are required to have this permission. View access is instead assigned with each template (Access tab).

profile-edit
Enables a user to edit their profile and change their password. This permission is intended for administrative users, as the profile editor is part of the ProcessWire admin.

Optional core permissions
These permissions are not installed by default, but are recognized by the core and can be installed from Access > Permissions > Add New.

page-clone
This permission is available only if the core ProcessPageClone module is installed. A user with this permission is allowed to clone (duplicate) pages. The clone option appears as a "copy" action for each page in the PageList or Lister modules.

page-clone-tree
This permission is available only if the core ProcessPageClone module is installed. A user with this permission is allowed to clone (duplicate) a entire tree of pages. Also requires page-clone permission.

page-edit-created
When combined with page-edit permission, this optional permission limits a user to editing only pages that they created. Unlike other permissions, this permission reduces access by reducing the scope of the page-edit permission. Read more in: Limiting edit access with page-edit-created permission.

page-edit-images
Use the image editor to manipulate (crop, resize, etc.) images. When not installed, the permission is delegated to page-edit permission instead. Meaning, adding this permission just adds another level of granularity so that you can control access to the image editing tools within image fields.

page-edit-trash-created
This optional permission lets a user trash pages that they created, so long as they are still editable to them. If the user already has page-delete permission to a page, then page-edit-trash-created permission is not necessary and does nothing. As a result, this permission is only useful in cases where a user does not have page-delete permission, but you still want them to be able to only trash pages they specifically created. Once a page has been trashed, only the superuser can restore or permanenty delete it. Requires ProcessWire 3.0.31 or newer (or 2.8.31+).

page-hide
Enables user to hide or un-hide a page. When a page is hidden, it is not visible in front-end navigation and does not appear in $pages->find() API calls unless "include=hidden", "include=unpublished" or "include=all" is specified in the selector. A page can be hidden or un-hidden from the page editor Settings tab > Status field, or directly in the Page List/Lister inline page actions. When this permission is not installed, page-hide permission is inclusive of page-edit permission. Also requires page-edit permission and ProcessWire 2.6.15 or newer.

page-lister-[name]
Replace "[name]" with the name of Lister and this enables you to assign access to that specific Lister. Requires ProcessWire 2.6 or newer, the ListerPro module, and page-lister permission as a pre-requisite.

page-publish
When installed, a user must have this permission in order to publish any content on the site. Without this permission a user may only edit and/or create unpublished pages, where allowed. Use this permission in instances where you want certain user roles to be able to create (or edit) unpublished pages for someone else's approval. User roles without this permission cannot make edits to existing published content or publish new content.

page-rename
Change the name of published pages the user is allowed to edit.

User admin permissions
user-admin
Enables a user to administer all other users in the system (except superusers). Enables access to the Access > Users section of the admin. Also requires page-edit permission. When a ProcessWire 2.6.10+ system also has user-admin-all permission installed, the behavior of this permission is changed. See the following permissions for more details.

user-admin-all
When installed, this permission takes over the behavior of the user-admin permission, reducing the user-admin permission to just being able to edit "guest" users. The user-admin-all permission is primarily useful when combined with a user-admin-[role] permission, as described next. Users that you want to have this permission must also have page-edit and user-admin permission. Requires ProcessWire 2.6.10 or newer. See also discussion and examples of user-admin permissions.

user-admin-[role]
Enables editing of all users with the given [role]. Replace "[role]" with the name of the role you want to provide edit access to. Also requires page-edit and user-admin permission. Requires ProcessWire 2.6.10 or newer. See also discussion and examples of user-admin permissions.

Multi-language page edit permissions
Multi-language page edit permissions are primarily useful for limiting language access for translator-specific roles. If no multi-language page edit permissions are installed, users with edit access to a given page may edit it in any of the available languages (the default behavior).

Multi-language page-edit permissions require page-edit permission, ProcessWire core 2.6.3 or newer, and core modules: LanguageSupport and LanguageSupportFields, plus one or more multi-language fields. For more details, please see: Language Page Edit Permissions.

page-edit-lang-default
Enables access to edit fields on a page in the "default" language. This permission is also required to create and/or delete pages, since pages must exist in the default language before they can in other languages. Applicable to a multi-language environment with multi-language fields.

More about page-edit-lang-default
In ProcessWire, the one required language is "default", and this can refer to whatever language you want it to. Because the default language is always named "default", the corresponding permission is always named page-edit-lang-default. Though note that this permission is not required, but if using these permissions, there's a good chance you'll want it.

As always in a ProcessWire multi-language site, a page must be active in the default language before it can be active in other languages. The default language is the foundation of the page. As a result, a user must have page-edit-lang-default permission if they need to be able to create new pages or delete existing pages (see also page-edit-lang-none permission).

If a user just needs to translate existing pages, then they don't need page-edit-lang-default permission, unless they are translating from one language into the default language.

page-edit-lang-[name]
Provides edit access to fields in a named language. Replace "[name]" with the name of the language. Applicable to a multi-language environment with multi-language fields.

More about page-edit-lang-[name]
Once you add a language page-edit permission to your system, all multi-language fields in that language are locked for edits unless the user has the corresponding page-edit-lang-name permission in one of their roles. Meaning, you'll likely want to update the permissions on your user roles (checking the new permission boxes) after adding language page-edit permissions.

If you have a language in your system, but don't have a corresponding page-edit-lang-name permission added, then the language remains editable by everyone that already has edit access to the page and field. As a result, you only need to create page-edit-lang-name permissions for languages that you want to place limits upon… though we'd assume in many cases that would be all languages in your system.

page-edit-lang-none
Provides edit access to non-multi-language fields in the page editor. Applicable to a multi-language environment with multi-language fields.

More about page-edit-lang-none
When present, this permission refers to all non-multi-language fields in the page editor. If you have this permission in your system, and a user does not have it, then their edit access will be limited to multi-language fields only, in the language(s) they have access to.

This permission is useful when you want to create user role(s) for the purpose of translating pages in one language to another. The translator need only focus on the fields that need translation. All of the non-multi-language fields are simply not shown in the page editor to users that don't have this permission.

If using this permission, be sure to add it to the user roles that DO need edit access to all of the page fields. Otherwise those fields will be invisible to them as well.

Also note that when this permission is present in your system, a user must have it in order to create or delete pages (just like with the page-edit-lang-default permission). That's because when a user doesn't have this permission, they don't have access to modify non-multi-language fields like Template and Parent, among others. Chances are, this behavior is exactly what you'd want for a translation-only role.

lang-edit
In ProcessWire 2.6.23 (2.7) and newer you can add this permission to give users access to the language tools in Setup > Languages. This is largely useful for performing translations of static files like when creating language packs, or when translating phrases in your site template files. If you want to limit access to only a specific language, install the page-edit-lang-[name] permissions as described above, and ProcessWire will also consider these for access to language pages in Setup > Languages.
