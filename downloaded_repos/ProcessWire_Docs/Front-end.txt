Topics on using the ProcessWire API to render output on the front-end of your site with your template files.
Output strategies
Template files receive content and how they deliver it to the user is what we call the output strategy. There are a few different options and this section covers each in detail.
URL segments and routing
URL segments enable your page’s template file to become a URL router or controller to act upon different URLs sent to it.
Include & bootstrap
Use ProcessWire’s API in other PHP apps and shell scripts… It’s easy!
Front-end editing
Edit pages on the front-end of your site with the core PageFrontEdit module.
Pagination
This module renders navigation for pagination. Such navigation usually appears as a list of "1, 2, 3, next…" links at the bottom of search results.
