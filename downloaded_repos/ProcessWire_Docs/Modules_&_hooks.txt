A module is a type of plugin that runs in ProcessWire, and they come in many flavors. At its core, ProcessWire is a platform for executing modules, and much ProcessWire is built upon these modules. Hooks enable you to intercept and modify events in ProcessWire and can be used both inside and outside of modules.
