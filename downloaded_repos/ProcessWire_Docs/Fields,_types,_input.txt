Additional documentation and details on using various different kinds of field types and input fields in ProcessWire.
Introduction to fields
Fields are where the content is actually stored for pages. This page provides more information about Fields, Fieldtypes and Inputfields.
Field dependencies
Input and field dependencies enable you to specify the conditions under which a particular field in the page editor is shown or required.
Repeaters
The repeater fieldtype enables you to create a group of fields and make it repeatable in any quantity on your page. This opens many new possibilities with how you might manage and structure data.
Textarea
The Textarea Fieldtype is designed to hold any amount of text. Typically Textarea is used for multi-line text values. It is also used for rich text (CKEditor) fields.
Select options
The Options Fieldtype provides single and multi choice selectable options in ProcessWire, as an alternative to using Page fields.
Images
This page outlines using and manipulating image fields — one of the most commonly used in ProcessWire.
Multi-language fields
ProcessWire supports various kinds of multi-language text fields. This page outlines how to use them.
CKEditor
CKEditor is the rich text editor used by ProcessWire via the module InputfieldCKEditor. On a default installation of ProcessWire, there is typically a “body” field which uses CKEditor.
