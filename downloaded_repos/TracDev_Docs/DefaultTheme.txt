Ideas and plans for improving Trac's default theme
Tools
While working on
#10012
, I noticed a lot of replication of CSS rules, and when I had to make more of them, I noted in a comment from which rule I copied from. I believe we could take this to the next level and use some more powerful format for specifying the CSS rules, like
​
LESS
or
​
Stylus
(see
ticket:633#comment:15
).
