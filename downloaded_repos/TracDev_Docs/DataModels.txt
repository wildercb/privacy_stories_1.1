Improvements to Trac's data models
Trac's datamodels are usually implemented in the
<subsystem>/model.py
files.
In the current situation (1.0.x/1.1.1), we have different APIs and different conventions for the datamodels. This page describes a few issues where the API and conventions can be improved and made more consistent.
Representation of data
Standardize missing values
For tickets, when a field is unset the database value is set to
None
/
NULL
(
#11018
). When retrieving
NULL
values from the database, we get
None
in Python, and the value returned from the model depends on the field type:
For text fields, the empty string is returned from the model using the special value
​
empty
. See for example what we do for
ticket fields
​
.
For time fields,
None
is returned.
The pattern could be extended to other model classes, and even the
Ticket
model should be reviewed to ensure that all fields follow the pattern.
NOT NULL
columns
Validation of the ticket summary is done in the
IRequestHandler
​
, to prevent creating a ticket with an empty summary. The schema could be changed to use
NOT NULL
in the column specification, since the empty string is
replaced with NULL
​
. Alternatively, a
TracError
could be raised in the
Ticket
model when
insert
ing or
update
ing a ticket with an empty summary (
#12458
).
Class methods
Class methods are used for table-wide queries. One such example is
select
.
The signature of the
select
method is not consistent across all classes.
The
Milestone
class has an
include_completed
​
parameter in the
select
method.
We could reconcile the inconsistency by having
where
,
limit
and
order_by
parameters on each method, with the parameters directly mapping to phrases in the SQL query.
This would make the methods more generally useful to plugin developers.
Not only is the interface inconsistent, but also the return value. In most cases a generator is returned by
select
, however some
select
methods return a list:
trunk/trac/ticket/model.py@13060:1137#L1128
​
trunk/trac/ticket/model.py@13060:1234#L1222
