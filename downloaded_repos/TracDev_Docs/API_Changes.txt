Guidelines for API changes
Always try to maintain API compatibility.
If an interface
must
be changed:
try to maintain the old interface for at
least one minor version change (e.g.
0.10
→
0.11
)
log deprecation warnings if the old method is used
document the API change:
in
TracDev/ApiChanges/<version>
or in the
API changes
field of the corresponding ticket if any.
in the docstring, make use of the
​
.. versionmodified::
and
.. deprecated::
directives.
If the old interface can't be maintained, document it as such in the appropriate TracDev/ApiChanges/
<version>
page.
Notable changesets modifying the API prior to 1.0 have been recorded in
a previous version
of this page.
