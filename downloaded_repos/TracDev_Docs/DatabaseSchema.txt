attachment
Descriptions of attachments, the files themselves are stored on disk.
auth_cookie
User login cookies.
cache
Synchronization table for process- and thread-local caches.
component
Values that can be used in a ticket's "component" field. The

column is used as the default assignee for new tickets, if not overridden at the time of ticket submission.
enum
Maps integer IDs for issues' priorities, severities, etc. to human-readable names.
milestone
Project milestones.
node_change
First half of the repository cache: for every changeset (as identified by the revision number), this table contains the nodes (files or directories) that have been added, modified or deleted.
notify_subscription
User preferences for notification subscriptions.
notify_watch
User preferences for notification watches.
permission
Username/action pairs describing who is allowed to do what. This table's contents also hold permission groups.
report
Stores the SQL to generate canned database reports.
repository
Stores cached and configured repository properties.
revision
Second half of the repository cache: changesets, containing the revision number, author, time, and log message. The list of files and directories modified by a changeset can be found by joining with
node_change
on the
rev
column.
session
Last user visit time.
session_attribute
Information about user settings, including name, email, and diff options.
system
System information such as the database version and repository cache metadata.

comment
is special: it associates a comment with a set of field changes.

The values of custom ticket fields.
version
As in
component
and
milestone
, this holds the options of the drop-down
version
list on the ticket form. Every version can have a

set, although that is not presently used other than for ordering the list of versions in the UI.
wiki
Wiki pages, including old revisions.
