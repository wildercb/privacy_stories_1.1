Duplicate check when filing new tickets
A
new duplicate ticket
is a new ticket that has been posted before. For the background into the issues surrounding new duplicate tickets, see the following discussions:
​
NewTicket duplicates discussion
​
ticket duplicate discussion
Note that a plugin exists that implements a search for possible duplicate ticket entry:
​
DuplicateTicketSearchPlugin
and partially implements the
#MostFrequentDuplicatesPlugin
proposal below.
Good implementations of checking new duplicate tickets are:
​
Ubuntu LaunchPad
. See screenshots below.
​
Stackoverflow
. After you type in a question, the area immediately below the title (summary, in Trac) is populated with a list of questions that possibly match based on the text. This would fit into the existing Trac UI fairly easily.

MostFrequentDuplicatesPlugin
Here is an idea for a plugin that could be used for doing semi-automated duplicate checking. It is a more automated version of what is described in the
MostFrequentDuplicates
page, by using the information collected there
before
new tickets get created.
We could use a bit more structure in that page to associate patterns to tickets. Examples:
Pattern
HTMLParseError: bad end tag
Duplicate of
#4365
Note
related to a
SilverCity
bug
Pattern
PyGIT.py.*cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects
Duplicate of
#6976
Note
This is a bug in the
​
TH:GitPlugin
for Trac on nonexistent paths, see
​
TH:ticket:2671
Before ticket creation, the ticket description is scanned for the available (multi-line) patterns and if a match is found, a validation warning should be returned (see
tags/trac-0.11/trac/ticket/api.py@#L127
​
). This will prevent ticket creation and show a warning which can display the duplicate ticket and the associated note. See also the
InterWiki
​
module for hints about retrieving data from a Wiki page.
