JavaScript for Trac and plugin development
JavaScript is used in Trac to add dynamics to web interface elements on the browser side:
expanding/folding in the
TracBrowser
providing
keyboard shortcuts
and many other features
This page lists some of the uses of this language in Trac.
We also adhere to a
JavaScript coding style
.
Third party libraries
jQuery
Trac makes heavy use of the
​
JQuery
library. Access to this library contents is provided through the main function named
$
, which is shorthand for the
jQuery
namespace and it is possible to use the full name instead. However, other libraries may use
$
too, which may cause conflicts. To avoid these conflicts, switch jQuery into non-conflict mode with
jQuery.noConflict()
call, see
​
http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
.
You will see many blocks in Trac that use $ for jQuery. They do it in their local scope defined by nameless function or closure:
(function($) { /* some code that uses $ */ })(jQuery)
There is a good description of closures and
(function(){})()
construct at
​
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures
.
$(document).ready()
To execute and modify the DOM tree the
JavaScript
function should wait until a page fully loads. With jQuery it looks like:
$(document).ready(function_name);
In non-conflicting mode, code that executed in Trac on page startup is enveloped in closure and looks like:
jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ... });
Upgrade
Minified versions of a given release
x.y.z
of jQuery can be found in URLs with the following pattern:
http://code.jquery.com/jquery-x.y.z.min.js
Don't forget to update the default value for the
jquery_location
setting. See for example
r16094
.
jQuery UI
Since Trac version 1.0, we also bundle
​
jQuery UI
, a set of standard user interface elements (UI).
Upgrade
A specific
x.y.z
version of the minified Javascript code can be downloaded from URLs using the following pattern:
http://code.jquery.com/ui/x.y.z/jquery-ui.min.js
This corresponds to the minified version of the whole of jQuery UI, ie we don't use a subset of what is currently used by Trac on purpose, so that plugins can assume they have access to all jQuery UI components.
We use a custom theme built using the
​
Themeroller jQuery UI Theme Roller
for Trac 1.0.0.
The
jquery-ui.css
​
file contains a link to the theme roller with preselected values.
jQuery UI Timepicker Addon
We use the
​
Timepicker extension
for the standard jQuery UI datepicker.
Get the release that matches the jQuery UI version:
https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-Timepicker-Addon/tree/v1.1.1
The
jquery-ui-timepicker-addon.js
file is compressed using the
​
Google Closure Compiler
, which gives good results. The minified file is saved in
trac/htdocs/js/jquery-ui-addons.js
​
.
Finally, the
jquery-ui-timepicker-addon.css
file is merged with the
trac/htdocs/css/jquery-ui-addons.css
​
file.
TracIni
settings
After an upgrade, don't forget to update the default values for the
jquery_ui_location
and
jquery_ui_theme_location
settings. See for example
r16094
.
