Trac URLs
The following URLs are specified relative to base Trac URL:
/chrome
path to be used for any kind of
static resource
, usually
images
,
.css
and
.js
. They are called
static
, because they don't require any server-side processing and can be served as-is. In fact to avoid
Trac request handling
many people prefer to have those static resources
served directly by the web server
.
/chrome/site
accesses static resources for
TracInterfaceCustomization
contained in the
environment's
htdocs/
directory.
/chrome/shared
accesses static resources in a shared location defined by the
htdocs_dir
option in the
inherit
section of the
TracIni
.
/chrome/common
accesses static resources used by Trac. These are usually found in the
htdocs/
subdirectory of the Trac installation.
/chrome/<pluginname>
accesses static resources for a plugin.
All static resources can be exported with
trac-admin deploy
command to serve them independently. The process is described in detail in
TracInstall#MappingStaticResources
. Just do not forget to re-export them after installing new plugins or upgrading Trac.
