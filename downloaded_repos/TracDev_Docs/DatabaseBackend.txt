Alternative Ideas for Database Independence
Object-Relational Mapper
An ORM could be used to provide a unified object interface to different relational database management systems that Trac supports:
​
SQLAlchemy
, which is also quite advanced, is discussed further on the
SqlAlchemy
page. The following plugins exist that implement querying the Trac database using this library:
​
SqlAlchemyQueryMacro
​
TracSqlAlchemyBridgeIntegration
​
ADODB
, the fast database abstraction layer for use with Microsoft ADO with a
​
version available for Python
.
​
SQLObject
is a Python based library to accomplish the goal of database independence.
​
Modeling
is another, more advanced OR-Mapper.
Store Tickets and Wiki pages directly in the Subversion repository
A compelling idea with many advantages. A page advocating this plan is

. There has also been a discussion on the Trac mailing list, of which the arguments are summarized on the page
