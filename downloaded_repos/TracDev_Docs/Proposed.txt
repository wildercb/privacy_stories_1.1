Proposed changes
Sometimes it can be useful to demonstrate an upcoming change on a live demo site on t.e.o (
testing
), so that the behavior or the layout can be discussed and fine-tuned before committing.
We have some infrastructure in place to achieve this for the "+testing" git reference, which is usually a temporary merge of the git branches corresponding to the tickets being demonstrated.
