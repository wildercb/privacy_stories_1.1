Scratchpad for user interface design
This part of the
TracDev
hierarchy is complementary to the
Proposals
and collects improvement ideas at the level of pages, so we mainly focus here on the feature set and the user interface.
Beside the obvious goals of trying to keep our interface as simple and intuitive as possible, we can also try to be consistent with what other similar systems do ("convergence").
This is also a place where multiple tickets for a similar functional module can be discussed together with suggestions for improvements so that we can design something coherent.
