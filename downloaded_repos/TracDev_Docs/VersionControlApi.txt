Trac Version Control System API
Trac uses a thin abstraction layer between the Trac application code and the code that accesses concrete version control systems. This layer can be found in the
trac.versioncontrol
â€‹
package.
Accessing the Version Control System
You can get access to a concrete
Repository
implementation using the
get_repository()
method of the
Environment
object:
from
trac.env
import
Environment
env
=
Environment
(
'/path/to/projenv'
)
repos
=
env
.
get_repository
()
try
:
# Do whatever you like with the repository object here
finally
:
repos
.
close
()
From Trac 0.12
env.get_repository()
is deprecated, replaced by the
RepositoryManager
interface. The above code becomes:
from
trac.env
import
Environment
from
trac.versioncontrol
import
RepositoryManager
env
=
Environment
(
'/path/to/projenv'
)
repos
=
RepositoryManager
(
env
)
.
get_repository
(
None
)
try
:
# Do whatever you like with the repository object here
finally
:
repos
.
close
()
To access a repository other than the default pass a
reponame
in place of
None
. In class that inherits from
Component
it is more convenient to use
self.env
than instantiate
Environment
manually.
