Release Testing
To ensure that our releases are well tested and with as few bugs as possible, we need your help.
If you have a Trac installation with a combination of OS, database or frontend not represented in the list below, please consider adding yourself to the list.
What's expected of me?
At the beginning of the release testing period you will be added to the CC-list of the release ticket, where you will find details on where to download the release candidate. The ticket might also mention additional information on specific areas/features to test. But in most cases it is enough to verify that the release works as expected on your system. Running the
unit tests
and
functional tests
and getting a green light would be a plus. 
See
Testing Scenarios
below for some suggestions.
Once you have upgraded your server to the release candidate, please let us know by updating the release ticket. If you detect an issue, report it on that ticket as well.
