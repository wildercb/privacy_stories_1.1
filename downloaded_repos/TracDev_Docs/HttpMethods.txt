Trac HTTP Methods
To protect against
​
CSRF attacks
and to adhere to the HTTP RFC rules on

,
Check that all requests that create, modify or delete resources use the HTTP POST method.
Use real server-side confirmation for deletion of wiki pages and attachments, instead of the
JavaScript
confirmation dialog.
