These pages provide information about the development of Trac and its
​
extensions
. It is written for skilled
​
Python
developers who have experience using Trac.
Development is largely coordinated online.
Source code is managed in repositories and for Trac this is a combination of the main trunk in Subversion and mirror in
GitHub
. See
TracRepositories
,
TracSubversion
,
TracGit
and
TracMercurial
for more information.
We also keep track of what has been deprecated or removed between releases, see our
Release Notes
and the summary of
API Changes
. API Changes are summarised using the
API change
field attached to every ticket; this is a feature implemented since 1.0dev.
How to get started?
Start by setting up a
development environment
and become familiar with
installing Trac
and creating new
TracEnvironment
s.
Then, you should get familiar with Trac's
ComponentArchitecture
,
PluginDevelopment
and
DatabaseApi
.
The
TracTroubleshooting
page contains some debugging tips which are also quite useful during development.
When you're ready to contribute changes, note that we're picky about our
CodingStyle
when
SubmittingPatches
. For changes to be accepted, the modified Trac source should still pass the
UnitTests
and the
FunctionalTests
. Ideally, also contribute new tests.
Discussions about Trac Development happen on the
​
Trac-dev mailing list
. New development ideas are usually best discussed first on that list, it's a quick and easy way to get feedback on any given topic or question. As usual, search the archive first, to avoid rehashing old discussions. For longer term developments, or for documentation purposes, use the wiki.
To refer to a mail from Trac-dev in this wiki, use the
googlegroups
InterWiki
prefix, for example:
​
googlegroups:trac-dev:1b9c4e3eaeda3a0d
. You can see the message identifier  in the address bar of your browser when viewing the message in Individual Message view mode. You can go there from the default threaded view by clicking on
More options
and then on the
Individual Message
or
Show Original
links.
