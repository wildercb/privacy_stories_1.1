.
Context
The
TracNotification
system has not kept up with the requirements that users, administrators and developers have. The
​
th:AnnouncerPlugin
was developed to provide a more flexible notification system.
An alternative
proposal
to replace the TracNotification system with the AnnouncerPlugin has existed for some years.
Proposal
Improve the TracNotification system by:
Deprecating the inflexible
Notify
class hierarchy.
Adding new infrastructure (based on AnnouncerPlugin's proven design where appropriate) on a topic-by-topic basis.
Adopting some general advanced features.
Enabling plugins to provide more experimental or very specific features.
Coexistence with Announcer
This proposal would not integrate or replace Announcer as a whole. Future versions of Announcer would ideally be compatible with new TracNotification system and rebase additional non-core features on the new core infrastructure.
Future versions of announcer could also provide upgrade paths from older versions of the plugin to the new core infrastructure.
Database tables, configuration sections and extensions points adopted in core from Announcer may best be renamed to avoid confusion and upgrade troubles (especially when slightly modified).
