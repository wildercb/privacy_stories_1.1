Ticket Types
This feature is now integrated in Trac since
milestone:0.9
(see
[1691]
)
Rationale
When creating a new ticket, Trac enables you to select 
the appropriate type for that ticket.
Indeed, a
ticket
can represent anything ranging from
a problem report, a support request, an idea for a new feature
or actually any artifact that fits in your development process.
Among issue trackers, Trac was initially on the
undifferentiated
camp,
everything was treated the same and it was only from the description
that one could tell in which category a ticket would fit.
However, the need for a more structured partitioning of the ticket type
appeared (e.g.
#919
,
#1399
) and several Trac sites were actually 
tweaking the
severity
field to be the
ticket type
, or creating
TracTicketsCustomFields
for that purpose.
Now, with the ticket
type
field, one is able to store this information as 
part of the core properties of the ticket, which permits to display
the type of a ticket in more interesting places, usually next to 
the ticket number.
What does it look like?
Those screenshot correspond to intermediate development status: to be updated (or removed?)
in the Ticket page's title:
in the
TracTimeline
:
Also, it's the first field you can select when creating a new ticket:
What if I don't like ticket types?
No problem. With
trac-admin
, you can
use the
ticket_type
command to perform a few actions on ticket types:
add
change
list
order
remove
You can customize the ticket types to match your local requirements.
If you delete
all
ticket types, then the feature is gone!
Trac will work the same way it ever did without ticket types
(i.e.
Trac 0.[5-8].x
behavior).
Why is the severity field gone?
Trac strives to be a simple to install, simple to use system.
Offering in the default setup a combination of ticket type, 
severity, priority and milestone was deemed too daunting 
for new users.
The advised configuration is therefore:
type
, for categorizing the ticket
Defect
:  a bug, anything that does not work as expected
Enhancement
: a new feature or an improvement over an existing one
Task
: everything else, something that needs to be done
milestone
used for scheduling
priority
, for asserting the importance of a ticket
blocker
: basic functionality is not available until this is fixed
critical
: severe loss of data due to the defect or highly needed enhancement
major
: defect with major impact / big enhancement
minor
: defect with minor impact / small enhancement
trivial
: defect with little or no impact / cosmetic enhancement
However, some users would like to keep the current distinction
between
severity
and
priority
:
type
, for categorizing the ticket
milestone
used for scheduling
severity
for trying to assert the
objective
importance or impact of the ticket
(the values would be the same as those listed for the
priority
field above)
priority
to help organize the scheduling within a given milestone
(fields like
highest
,
high
,
normal
,
low
,
lowest
).
This is more a
subjective
field, based on other considerations than the
objective severity (typically those of a product manager :-) ).
In order to support that usage, the
severity
field has been kept
in the database. It simply needs to be "activated" by using
trac-admin
's
severity add
command, or through the web administration page.
Other issues
Different custom fields depending on ticket type
By:
pkou at ua.fm
It would be nice if different sets of custom fields are visible to end user when ticket type is changed.
Rationale: Different ticket types can require different types of additional information that needs to be entered, for example:
Event
: Due date, location;
Enhancement
: Source, Benefit, Link to business case/requirement, Review status, Approval status, Links to specifications;
Defect
: Customer ID
Task
:
No additional custom fields.
Hidden custom fields are initialized with zero/empty values.
Standard fields represent common information that should be available in every ticket.
Affected areas of functionality:
When existing ticket is displayed, then unnecessary custom fields are hidden;
When new ticket is created, then custom fields are displayed depending on selected ticket type.
