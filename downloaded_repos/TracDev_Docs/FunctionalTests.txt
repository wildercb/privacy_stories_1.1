Trac Functional Tests
Automated functional tests are integrated in the test suite, see
TracDev/UnitTests
. They are formed by executing a series of unit tests.
For detailed informations about functional tests, see:
​
apidoc:dev/testing
source:branches/0.12-stable/TESTING-README
​
(old)
These functional tests do not replace manual testing.
Extra dependencies
​
twill
— simple scripting language for Web browsing
​
lxml
— used for XHTML validation
Those packages can be installed with
pip
:
pip install
twill
==
0
.9.1
pip install lxml
Note that one test requires that the
svn
program can be executed.
Windows specific dependencies
There's an additional dependency on Windows:
​
fcrypt
(Trac < 1.2)
​
passlib
(Trac ≥ 1.2)
The usual install method will work:
pip install http://www.carey.geek.nz/code/python-fcrypt/fcrypt-1.3.1.tar.gz
pip install passlib
If
fcrypt
is not installed, you will get the following error when running the tests with Trac 0.12 - 1.0:
Warning: cannot parse password for user "crypt" without the "crypt" module
or this warning starting with Trac 1.2:
The crypt module is not found. Install the passlib package from PyPI.
lxml on Windows
pip install lxml
should just work. Since lxml 3.4, pre-compiled binaries are available as wheels. Before lxml 3.4, pip tried installing from source releases which require more dependencies like Cython, libxml2 and libxslt, which can be difficult to install on Windows.
Running the tests
To run the functional tests, execute:
PYTHONPATH=. python ./trac/tests/functional/__init__.py
or:
make functional-test
This is starting from Trac 0.12, as Trac 0.11 has no Makefile.
Discussion / Feedback
Something to consider here: using twill's wsgi_intercept capability, and making these part of the unit tests.
