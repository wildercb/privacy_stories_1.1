Modified Dependencies
See
​
gmessage:trac-dev:nkMUY_8ILF0/rg1rsArDIewJ
for a discussion about what dependencies we'll support in Trac 1.4.
jQuery and jQuery UI (bundled)
Upgraded:
jQuery to 1.12.4
jQuery UI to 1.12.1
jQuery Timepicker to 1.6.3
Babel (optional)
Jinja2 (mandatory)
Jinja2 ≥ 2.9.3 is required.
Genshi (optional, deprecated)
Genshi support is deprecated as the templating library, having been replaced by Jinja2. Genshi ≥ 0.6 is still needed to use many plugins.
The goal is to remove Genshi support during the 1.5.x development cycle, at the latest, so plugin developers will be urged to do the switch as well, as explained in
PortingFromGenshiToJinja
