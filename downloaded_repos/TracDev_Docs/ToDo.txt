Some of the key features that are being developed are:
Wiki

Ticket
Sort order of tickets in search results: currently creation time first as opposed to most recent modification time first.
Miscellaneous
In
TracInstall#GeneratingtheTraccgi-bindirectory
there is mention of
chicken/egg
problem with
trac-admin deploy
. We should support a direct
trac-admin deploy <target>
call syntax, ie without the need to specify a (dummy) environment.
