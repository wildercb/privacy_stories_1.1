* How do I implement my own encounter forms into LibreEHR?

The encounter form system and API is intended to support a wide variety of diverse encounter forms. To create your own encounter forms, you have two options: you can implement them manually yourself, or you can contract PennFirm do generate them for you. If you would like PennFirm to generate forms for you, please email info@libreehr.net, and you will be given a fax number to which all forms may be sent. PennFirm will create your forms, including layout, reporting, etc. and email them to you within 1 week.

If you would like to make forms yourself, please begin by taking a look at the existing forms that come with the default installation of LibreEHR. The Documentation/3rd Party Form API.txt document details the user-level functions available for form developers. While implementing your own forms, please remember that compatibility with the rest of the LibreEHR platform is crucial, for correct report generation and smooth functionality.
