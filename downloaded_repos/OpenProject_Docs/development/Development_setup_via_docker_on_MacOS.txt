OpenProject development setup via docker (MacOS)
This guide covers observed nuances with the docker runtime on MacOS. Please ensure youâve gone through the general
OpenProject development setup via docker
guide before proceeding.
Docker on MacOS File System Performance
Docker on Mac is
known to have file system performance issues
due to the fact that Docker runs in a virtual machine on MacOS. Container operations are slower than they would be in a native Linux environment.
As Docker runs in a virtual machine, a shared filesystem is needed and applications such as OpenProject with large number of files may experience performance drawbacks.
Switching to VirtioFS filesystem implementation
can help improve the file system performance. Although Virtio FS is available on
Docker Desktop
,
Orbstack + VirtioFS
provides a more consistent experience in performance and resource usage; significantly less than docker desktop + VirtioFS.
According to OrbStack
, the overall architecture is similar to Docker Desktop but more specialized and lightweight.
The following is a benchmark performed on a

Orbstack Installation
Ref Quick Start Guide
here
brew
install
orbstack
Note:
You can use Docker contexts to run OrbStack and Docker Desktop side-by-side. Switching contexts affects all Docker commands you run from that point on.
Ref: Side-by-side
# Switch to OrbStack
docker context use orbstack
# Switch to Docker Desktop
docker context use desktop-linux
To view the list of docker contexts run:
docker context
ls
