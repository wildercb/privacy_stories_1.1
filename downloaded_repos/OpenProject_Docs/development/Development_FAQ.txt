Frequently asked questions (FAQ) for development
Is there an ER diagram (entity relationship diagram) for OpenProject?
No. The database layout is subject to continuous change. Every upgrade, even from one patch level release to the next, might change the database layout. Because of that, it is also not advisable to integrate on the database level (e.g. for data warehousing/dashboards).
Is there documentation for creating my own plugin?
The documentation for creating plugins is indeed limited at the moment. What we have is mostly
this one
and the
proto plugin
.
Which gateway provider does OpenProject use for 2FA by SMS?
We use MessageBird. At the moment this canât be changed.
