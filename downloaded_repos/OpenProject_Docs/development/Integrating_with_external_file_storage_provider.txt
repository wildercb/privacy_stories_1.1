Integrating with external file storage provider
External file storages can be integrated with OpenProject via the
File storages
module. A basic integration at least entails the ability to link work packages in OpenProject with files and folders in the external file storage. Currently supported file storages are:
Nextcloud
.
Checklist for new candidates
This section contains a checklist for new candidates for the development of a new file storage integration. It lists requirements, which are meant to be the very foundation of making the basic use cases work.
The file storage must have a HTTP API
The user must be able to authenticate the requests against the API.
Currently supported authentication methods: OAuth2 with authorization code with or without PKCE
The file storage must have uniquely identifiable files across the user context. (Any user must be able to find the file with the same identification data.)
The file storage must provide a direct link to open the file on the file storageâs web interface.
The file storage must be able to fetch an index for a location, providing all children files and folders on this location.
Optional: The file storage must provide a direct download link for the file.
Optional: The file storage must provide a direct upload link for files to a location on the file storage.

If you plan to integrate OpenProject with another external storage provider, either as an OpenProject core feature or as a plugin, please reach out to the OpenProject development team. We are currently in the process of making the integration of further storage provider easier for community developers.
