Extension Point :
INotificationDistributor
Interface
INotificationDistributor
Since
1.1.3
Module
trac.notification
Source
api.py
​
The
INotificationDistributor
sends
notification
events over some distribution channel, like email.
Purpose
Trac provides an extendible and flexible notification system, that historically has sent notifications by email. Notifications could however also be distributed by XMPP, SMS or any other messaging protocol.
Usage
Implementing the interface follows the standard guidelines found in
TracDev/ComponentArchitecture
and of course
TracDev/PluginDevelopment
.
A simple
transports()
method lists the names of the supported transports (protocols / distribution channels). The
distribute()
method distributes a message to one or more recipients. It receives the following parameters:
transport
: The name of the transports that should be used. One of those returned by
transports()
.
recipients
: A list of
(sid, authenticated, address, format)
tuples.
sid
: The Trac session ID of the recipient (or
None
).
authenticated
:
1
if the Trac session ID is authenticated,
0
otherwise.
address
: A protocol specific address to send the notification to. If it is
None
the implementation might still be able to send the message to the recipient using the
sid
/
authenticated
information somehow. (E.g. the
EmailDistributor
falls back to
IEmailAddressResolver
implementations.)
format
: MIME type of the message format to be used.
event
: A
trac.notification.api.NotificationEvent
instance describing the event about which the recipients should be notified.
The
event
is supposed to be formatted into a message in the given
format
using a
INotificationFormatter
.
Examples
The following example distributes notifications by SMS. (The
sms
library does not exist. Several commercial SMS services provide real APIs.)
