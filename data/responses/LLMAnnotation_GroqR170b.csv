Getting Started
Choosing an Instance
If you are used to sites like Reddit, then Lemmy works in a fundamentally different way. Instead of a single website like reddit.com, there are many different websites (called instances). These are operated by different people, have different topics and rules. Nevertheless, posts created in one instance can directly be seen by users who are registered on another. Its basically like email, but for social media.

This means before using Lemmy and registering an account, you need to pick an instance. For this you can browse the instance list and look for one that matches your topics of interest. You can also see if the rules match your expectations, and how many users there are. It is better to avoid very big or very small instances. But don't worry too much about this choice, you can always create another account on a different instance later.

[instance list screenshot]

Registration
Once you choose an instance, it's time to create your account. To do this, click sign up in the top right of the page, or click the top right button on mobile to open a menu with sign up link.

[registration page screenshot]

On the signup page you need to enter a few things:

Username: How do you want to be called? This name can not be changed and is unique within an instance. Later you can also set a displayname which can be freely changed. If your desired username is taken, consider choosing a different instance where it is still available.
Email: Your email address. This is used for password resets and notifications (if enabled). Providing an email address is usually optional, but admins may choose to make it mandatory. In this case you will have to wait for a confirmation mail and click the link after completing this form.
Password: The password for logging in to your account. Make sure to choose a long and unique password which isn't used on any other website.
Verify password: Repeat the same password from above to ensure that it was entered correctly.
There are also a few optional fields, which you may need to fill in depending on the instance configuration:

Question/Answer: Instance admins can set an arbitrary question which needs to be answered in order to create an account. This is often used to prevent spam bots from signing up. After submitting the form, you will need to wait for some time until the answer is approved manually before you can login.
Code: A captcha which is easy to solve for humans but hard for bots. Enter the letters and numbers that you see in the text box, ignoring uppercase or lowercase. Click the refresh button if you are unable to read a character. The play button plays an audio version of the captcha.
Show NSFW content: Here you can choose if content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only) should be shown.
When you are done, press the sign up button.

It depends on the instance configuration when you can login and start using the account. In case the email is mandatory, you need to wait for the confirmation email and click the link first. In case ""Question/Answer"" is present, you need to wait for an admin to manually review and approve your registration. If you have problems with the registration, try to get in contact with the admin for support. You can also choose a different instance to sign up if your primary choice does not work.

Following Communities
After logging in to your new account, its time to follow communities that you are interested in. For this you can click on the communities link at the top of the page (on mobile, you need to click the menu icon on the top right first). You will see a list of communities which can be filtered by subscribed, local or all. Local communities are those which are hosted on the same site where you are signed in, while all also contains federated communities from other instances. In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.

Another way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the ""sidebar"" button on mobile.

These previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.

Setting up Your Profile
Before you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to ""settings"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:

Displayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time
Bio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown
Matrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat
Avatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts
Banner: A header image for your profile page
On this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:

Blocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.
Interface language: Which language the user interface should use.
Languages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select ""Undetermined"" to see them.
Theme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.
Type: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.
Sort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.
Show NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only).
Show Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.
Show Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.
Bot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically
Show Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.
Show Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.
Show Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.
Send notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.
Start Posting
Finally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.

Other than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as ""not safe for work"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.

One more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right.

Using Actual
Accounts & Transactions

overview

 You can add as many accounts as you like. Adding all of your accounts (including things like mortgages) is a nice way to get an overview of all your finances.

Off-budget accounts
​
Actual makes a distinction between accounts being
for budget or off budget. 
Off budget accounts don't effect the budget and are meant to track stuff like investments and mortgages. Transactions in off budget accounts can't be categorized; they simply track balances over time.

For budget
accounts affect the budget, and transactions can be categorized. These are accounts where you want to track cash flow and use the budget, like checking accounts and credit cards.

Depending on your usage, savings accounts can either be on or off the budget. If you're not sure, we recommend keeping it on budget at the start.

Adding a new account
​

You can add an account to your budget at any time, however when you first install Actual you can use the
Add Account
button in the middle of the screen.

You can also add an account using the
+ Add account
button in the sidebar.

Two successive screens will appear with boxes asking you to fill in a few options

Create a Local Account or Link to GoCardless (See
Connecting Your Bank
)
Give your account a name
Is the account on or off budget
The current account balance

Off budget means that the balance is not reflected when you assign money to categories in your budget register

Here you can see how that looks when the options are completed.

If you select the Off Budget checkbox then change the account type the Off Budget checkbox will reset and will need to be re-selected each time the account type is changed

You can now see the account in the sidebar of Actual

Let's take it step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the actions mentioned. The text talks about adding accounts, which involves collecting information. Then, when managing these accounts, actions like closing or renaming them are mentioned, so that's using the data. There's also sharing involved when linking to services like GoCardless.\n\nNext, looking at data types, it's clear that financial data is a big part. They mention transactions, account balances, and details about mortgages and investments. Also, when adding an account, a name is given, which falls under account information.\n\nFor purposes, it's about managing finances, so the primary purpose is functionality. Security is involved when handling transactions and ensuring data is protected. There's also a bit of customization when naming accounts and setting them as on or off-budget.\n\nPutting this together into a story: The system collects financial data to manage user accounts, uses this data to handle transactions and account settings, and shares it when linking to external services. This setup helps users track their finances effectively, keeps their data secure, and allows for personalized account management.\n\nI think that covers all the necessary parts.

The purposes relate to the functionality of managing finances, security in handling transactions, and customization in naming accounts.  \n</R>""","""<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help annotate this text with the right metadata about privacy behaviors and stories. The text is about setting up an account on a platform called Lemmy and managing financial accounts on another platform called Actual. \n\nFirst, I'll break it down into sections. The first part is about choosing an instance and registering an account on Lemmy. The second part is about using Actual for managing finances, adding accounts, and transactions.\n\nFor the Lemmy registration part, the user provides a username, email, password, and sometimes answers a question or a CAPTCHA. So, the actions here are Collect and Use. They collect the email and account info for creating the account. They use this info for authentication and functionality, like sending notifications and password resets.\n\nNext, the user can set up their profile with a display name, bio, avatar, etc. So, they're using the account info to customize the user experience, which falls under Customization.\n\nThen, when the user starts posting or sending messages, they're using their account info and possibly sharing content, but the primary action is using the data for functionality and security, like managing notifications.\n\nNow, looking at the Actual part, the user adds financial accounts. The actions here are Collect and Use. They collect financial data like account balances and transaction history. The purposes are for functionality, tracking finances, and account management. \n\nI need to make sure I only use the allowed categories. So, for Actions, I have Collect and Use. Data Types include Account Information (like username, password, email) and Financial (like account balance, transactions). Purposes are Functionality, Security, and Account Management.\n\nPutting it all together, the stories should show how the data is collected and used for these purposes. For Lemmy, it's about account setup and usage. For Actual, it's about managing financial data for tracking and budgeting.\n\nI should structure each annotation with Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories, then explain the rationale for each. Making sure not to include any extra categories and keep it clear and concise.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \nAccount Information:  \n  Username:  \n  Password:  \n  Email address:  \nFinancial:  \n  Account Balance:  \n  Transactions:  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \nFunctionality, Security, Account Management  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n1.

They've provided a text about managing bank accounts and transactions in a financial app called Actual. My task is to annotate this text with specific metadata categories: Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. Then, I need to explain my rationale for each annotation.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the structure of the text. It's divided into sections like adding accounts, off-budget vs. on-budget accounts, adding a new account, closing or deleting an account, and renaming an account. Each section describes how the user interacts with the app, which involves various data types and actions.\n\nLooking at the actions, I see that the user can add, close, delete, and rename accounts. So, the actions here are \""Collect\"", \""Use\"", and \""Share\"". Collecting data when adding an account, using the data for functionalities, and sharing when linking to services like GoCardless.\n\nNext, the data types. The text mentions bank accounts, account balances, account names, and account types. These fall under Financial data types, specifically Bank Account, Account Balance, Account Information, and Assets. There's also mention of transactions and currencies, which are part of Financial data.\n\nFor purposes, the app uses the data for Functionality, allowing users to manage their finances. It also uses the data for Account Management, helping users track and organize their accounts. Additionally, data is used for Personal Analytics to provide an overview of their financial status.\n\nNow, creating the stories. Each story should tie together actions, data types, and purposes. For example, when a user adds a bank account, they provide details which are collected and used for managing their finances. Another story could be about renaming an account, which involves using account information to maintain accurate records.\n\nI also notice the user provided an example with S: and a story. I'll make sure to include similar concise stories in my annotation.\n\nI need to ensure I only use the categories provided and not introduce any new ones. Also, I should structure the annotations properly with XML tags and separate the rationale with the <R> tag.\n\nI'll start by listing each category with the relevant information, making sure to cover all sections of the text. Then, I'll explain why each annotation was chosen, linking the actions, data types, and purposes together.\n\nI should also consider any potential overlaps or multiple purposes for the same action. For example, collecting account data can serve both Functionality and Account Management.\n\nFinally, I'll review the annotations to ensure they accurately reflect the text and adhere to the specified categories and structure.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n\n<Data Types>  \nFinancial:  \n  Bank Account:  \n    Account Balance:  \n    Account Information:  \n      Account Name:  \n      Account Type:  \n  Assets:  \n    Bank Account:  \n</Data Types>  \n\n<Purposes>  \nFunctionality, Account Management, Personal analytics  \n</Purposes>  \n\n<Stories>  \n- We collect account data, account balance, and bank account information to manage and track financial accounts for functionality.  \n- We use account data, account balance, and bank account information to provide personal analytics and insights into financial transactions.  \n- We collect and use account information to allow users to rename and organize their accounts for better account management.  \n- We collect and use account balance and bank account data to enable closing or deleting accounts while maintaining financial records.  \n- We collect and use account details to differentiate between on-budget and off-budget accounts for accurate financial tracking.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- **Actions:** The text describes actions such as \""adding,\"" \""closing,\"" \""renaming,\"" and \""managing\"" accounts, which fall under \""Collect\"" and \""Use\"" as the system gathers and utilizes data to perform these actions.  \n- **Data Types:** The text references \""account data,\"" \""account balance,\"" \""bank account,\"" \""account name,\"" and \""account type,\"" which are categorized under Financial data types, specifically Bank Account and Account Information.  \n- **Purposes:** The purposes include \""Functionality\"" (enabling account management features), \""Account Management\"" (organizing and tracking accounts), and \""Personal analytics\"" (providing financial insights).  \n- **Stories:** The stories describe how the system collects and uses data to facilitate account management, tracking, and analytics, ensuring users can interact with their financial data effectively.""","""<think>\nOkay, so I need to help annotate this text with the appropriate categories. Let me read through the text first to understand what it's about.\n\nThe text is about adding, closing, deleting, and renaming accounts in a financial application called Actual. It explains how users can manage their accounts, including on-budget and off-budget accounts, and how transactions are handled differently based on the account type. There's also a part about connecting bank accounts and GoCardless, which suggests some integration with external financial services.\n\nNow, looking at the categories I need to use: Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Actions. The possible actions are Collect, Use, Share. The text talks about adding accounts, which involves collecting data like account details and balances. It also mentions using the data for managing budgets and transactions. I don't see any mention of sharing data, so probably only Collect and Use are relevant.\n\nNext, Data Types. The options include various categories like Contact Data, Health Data, Financial, Usage Data, etc. The text is about financial accounts, so Financial is the main category. Under Financial, there are subcategories like Bank Account, Account Balance, and possibly Assets since it mentions mortgages and investments. So I should include Financial as the main type and list the subcategories as Bank Account, Account Balance, and Assets.\n\nFor Purposes, the options are things like Contact, Analytics, Customization, Advertisement, Security, Tracking, Functionality, Accounts, Requirements. The text mentions using account data for budgeting and managing accounts. So purposes would likely be Functionality, as the app needs to function properly, and Account Management, which is about handling user accounts. There's also mention of personal analytics, so Analytics is another purpose.\n\nStories are supposed to be concise and describe how actions, data, and purposes interact. So I can create a story like: When a user adds a new account, the app collects bank account details and balance to manage the account and provide budget functionality.\n\nPutting it all together, the annotations would include Actions: Collect, Use; Data Types: Financial (with subcategories); Purposes: Functionality, Account Management, Analytics; and a story about adding an account.\n\nNow, for the rationale. I need to explain why I chose each category. For Actions, Collect is because the app gathers account info, and Use is because it uses that data for functionality. Data Types are Financial because it's about bank accounts and balances. Purposes include Functionality as the data is used to operate the app, Account Management for handling user accounts, and Analytics for budgeting insights. The story ties it all together by showing how the user's action of adding an account leads to data collection and usage for specific purposes.\n\nI think that covers everything. I should make sure to format it correctly with the tags and separate the annotations from the rationale with the <R> tag.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \nFinancial:  \n  Bank Account:  \n  Account Balance:  \n  Assets:  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \nFunctionality, Account Management, Analytics  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \nWhen a user adds a new account, the application collects bank account details and balance information to manage the account and provide budgeting functionality.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \nThe actions \""Collect\"" and \""Use\"" are annotated because the text describes gathering account information and using it for budget management. The data types include Financial, specifically Bank Account, Account Balance, and Assets, as these are central to the account management process. The purposes are Functionality, as the data is used to operate the app's features, Account Management for handling user accounts, and Analytics for budgeting insights. The story illustrates how adding an account involves collecting and using data for these purposes."""

Who is it for?
This project is for people who want to document their lives and those who have difficulty remembering details about the lives of people they care about.

Weâ€™ve also had a lot of positive reviews from people with Asperger syndrome, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and introverts who use our app every day.

What Monica isnâ€™t
Monica is not a social network and it never will be. Itâ€™s not meant to be social. Itâ€™s designed to be the opposite: itâ€™s for your eyes only.
Monica is not a smart assistant. It wonâ€™t guess what you want to do. Itâ€™s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.
Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.
Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. Itâ€™s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. Youâ€™re in control of your data.
Contribute
Do you want to lend a hand? Thatâ€™s great! We accept contributions from everyone, regardless of form.

Here are some of the things you can do to help.

Contribute as a community
Unlike Fight Club, the best way to help is to actually talk about Monica as much as you can in blog posts and articles, or on social media.
You can answer questions in the issue tracker to help other community members.
You can financially support Monicaâ€™s development on Patreon or by subscribing to a paid account.
Contribute as a developer
Read our Contribution Guide.
Install the developer version locally so you can start contributing.
Look for issues labelled â€˜Bugsâ€™ if you are looking to have an immediate impact on Monica.
Look for issues labelled â€˜Help Wantedâ€™. These are issues that you can solve relatively easily.
Look for issues labelled â€™Good First Issueâ€™. These issues are for people who want to contribute, but try to work on a small feature first.
If you are an advanced developer, you can try to tackle issues labelled â€˜Feature Requestsâ€™. These are harder to do and will require a lot of back-and-forth with the repository administrator to make sure we are going to the right direction with the product.
Principles, vision, goals and strategy
We want to use technology in a way that does not harm human relationships, unlike big social networks.

Principles
Monica has a few principles.

It should help improve relationships.
It should be simple to use, simple to contribute to, simple to understand, extremely simple to maintain.
It is not a social network and never will be.
It is not and never will be ad-supported.
Users are not and never will be tracked.
It should be transparent.
It should be open-source.
It should do one thing (documenting your life) extremely well, and nothing more.
It should be well documented.
Vision
Monicaâ€™s vision is to help people have more meaningful relationships.

Goals
We want to provide a platform that is:

really easy to use: we value simplicity over anything else.
open-source: we believe everyone should be able to contribute to this tool, and see for themselves that nothing nasty is done behind the scenes that would go against the best interests of the users. We also want to leverage the community to build attractive features and do things that would not be possible otherwise.
easy to contribute to: we want to keep the codebase as simple as possible. This has two big advantages: anyone can contribute, and itâ€™s easily maintainable on the long run.
available everywhere: Monica should be able to run on any desktop OS or mobile phone easily. This will be made possible by making sure the tool is easily installable by anyone who wants to either contribute or host the platform themselves.
Why Open Source?
Why is Monica open source? Is it risky? Could someone steal my code and use it to start a for-profit business that could hurt my own? Why reveal our strategy to the world? Weâ€™ve already received these kinds of questions in our emails.

The answer is simple: yes, you can fork Monica and create a competing project, make money from it (even if the license is not ideal for that) and we wonâ€™t be aware. But thatâ€™s okay, we donâ€™t mind.

We wanted to open source Monica for several reasons:

We believe that this tool can really change peopleâ€™s lives. We aim to make money from this project, but also want everyone to benefit. Open sourcing it will help Monica become much bigger than we imagine. We believe the software should follow our vision, but we must be humble enough to recognize that ideas come from everywhere and people may have better ideas than us.
You canâ€™t make something great alone. While Monica could become a company and hire a bunch of super smart people to work on it, you canâ€™t beat the manpower of an entire community. Open sourcing the product means bugs will be fixed faster, features will be developed faster, and more importantly, developers will be able to contribute to a tool that positively changes their own lives and the lives of other people.
Doing things in a transparent way leads to formidable things. People respect the project more when they can see how itâ€™s being worked on. You canâ€™t hide nasty things in the code. You canâ€™t do things behind the backs of your users. Doing everything in the open is a major driving force that motivates you to keep doing whatâ€™s right.
Once youâ€™ve created a community of passionate developers around your project, youâ€™ve won. Developers are powerful influencers: they create apps, discuss your product on forums, and share it with their networks. Nurture your relationship with developers â€“ users will follow.

So, the user provided a text about Monica, a personal relationship management system, and wants me to annotate it with specific categories: Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. They also want me to explain my rationale for each annotation.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully to understand what it's about. Monica is an open-source tool that helps users document their lives, manage contacts, set reminders, and more. It's compared to a CRM but for personal relationships. It mentions features like adding contacts, managing activities, uploading documents, and even handling multiple currencies. There's also a section on contributing, principles, vision, and why it's open-source.\n\nNow, looking at the categories I need to annotate:\n\n1. **Actions**: Collect, Use, Share. I need to identify which of these are present in the text.\n2. **Data Types**: There are several subcategories here, like Contact Data (phone, email, etc.), Health Data, Financial, etc. I'll need to see which types are mentioned.\n3. **Purposes**: These include things like Contact, Analytics, Customization, Advertisement, etc. I'll have to determine the intent behind the actions and data.\n4. **Stories**: These should be concise, showing how actions, data, and purposes interact.\n\nStarting with **Actions**. The text talks about adding contacts, managing activities, uploading documents, setting reminders. So, \""Collect\"" and \""Use\"" are definitely there. For example, collecting contact info and using it for reminders. I don't see any mention of sharing data, so probably only Collect and Use.\n\nNext, **Data Types**. The features include contact management, which involves names, emails, phone numbers, addresses. There's also mention of dates of birth for birthday reminders, images for uploads, and friends as part of contacts. So, under Contact Data, we have Email address, Date of Birth, Address, Name, Image, Friends. Additionally, since users can upload documents and photos, Image is included.\n\nFor **Purposes**, the primary ones seem to be Contact (managing relationships), Customization (allowing users to define fields, activity types), and Functionality (enabling the app to work as intended, like sending reminders). I don't see elements of Advertisement or Analytics mentioned, so those might not apply.\n\nNow, constructing **Stories**. These should tie together the actions, data, and purposes. For example, collecting email and date of birth for sending birthday reminders (Contact and Functionality). Using images for contact profiles (Customization). Managing friends' data for relationship management (Contact).\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the annotations with the appropriate tags and then explain each part in the rationale section. I need to make sure I only use the provided categories and that each story is clear and concise.\n\nI should also make sure that each story follows the format: \""We [action] [data type] for [purpose].\"" So, each story will be a separate sentence within the <Stories> tag.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll format the annotations and then provide a clear rationale for each part.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n\n<Data Types>  \nContact Data:  \n  Email address:  \n  Date of Birth:  \n  Address:  \n  Name:  \n  Image:  \n  Friends:  \n</Data Types>  \n\n<Purposes>  \nContact, Customization, Functionality  \n</Purposes>  \n\n<Stories>  \nWe collect email address, date of birth, address, name, image, and friends for contact.  \nWe collect email address, date of birth, address, name, image, and friends for customization.  \nWe collect email address, date of birth, address, name, image, and friends for functionality.  \nWe use email address, date of birth, address, name, image, and friends for contact.  \nWe use email address, date of birth, address, name, image, and friends for customization.  \nWe use email address, date of birth, address, name, image, and friends for functionality.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \nThe text describes Monica, a personal relationship management system, which collects and uses various types of data to enable users to document their lives, manage contacts, and customize their experience. The purposes of these actions are primarily for contact management, customization of the user experience, and ensuring the functionality of the application.  \n\nThe data types identified include contact data such as email address, date of birth, address, name, image, and friends, which are used to manage relationships, send reminders, and personalize the application. The actions of collecting and using this data are essential for the app's core functionalities, such as reminders for birthdays and customizing how contacts are managed.  \n\nThe stories illustrate how the data is collected and used for specific purposes, such as enabling contact management, customizing the user experience, and ensuring the app functions as intended.  \n</R>""","""<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to annotate this text properly. The user provided a document about Monica, a personal relationship management system, and some event management features. I need to identify the actions, data types, purposes, and create stories based on the categories given.\n\nFirst, looking at the actions. The text talks about collecting data like contacts, relationships, reminders, notes, etc. So \""Collect\"" is definitely an action. It also mentions using this data for reminders and customizing the app, so \""Use\"" is another action. There's no mention of sharing data, so I won't include \""Share\"".\n\nNext, data types. The features list includes contact management, which involves names, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, and more. So under Contact Data, I'll include Name, Phone Number, Email Address, and Address. There's also a mention of recording how the day went and uploading photos, so Diary and Image are relevant. The app allows adding notes and custom fields, which could be considered as Biographical Data. Since users can set reminders based on birthdays, Date of Birth is included. The app is translated into many languages, but I'm not sure if that's a data type. Maybe not, so I'll stick to the ones mentioned.\n\nFor purposes, the app is used for contact management, which is the primary purpose. It also allows customization of contact sheets and activity types, so Customization fits. The functionality of reminders, task management, and diary features fall under Functionality.\n\nNow, creating the stories. Each story should connect an action, data type, and purpose. So, for example, collecting contact data for contact management, using images for functionality in the diary, etc. I need to make sure each story is concise and covers the interaction of these elements.\n\nI also need to ensure I'm using the correct categories from the provided lists and not adding any new ones. For example, under Data Types, I can't make up new subcategories beyond what's given.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll list the actions, data types, purposes, and then the stories. Each story will be a separate line, following the format: We [action] [data type] for [purpose].\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Now I'll structure it properly with the XML tags as required.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n\n<Data Types>  \nContact Data:  \n  Name:  \n  Phone Number:  \n  Email address:  \n  Address:  \n  Date of Birth:  \n  Image:  \nBiographical Data:  \n  Notes:  \n  Custom fields:  \n</Data Types>  \n\n<Purposes>  \nContact, Customization, Functionality  \n</Purposes>  \n\n<Stories>  \nWe collect name, phone number, email address, and address for contact.  \nWe use image and date of birth for functionality.  \nWe collect notes and custom fields for customization.  \nWe use name, phone number, email address, and address for contact.  \nWe use image and date of birth for functionality.  \nWe use notes and custom fields for customization.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \nThe text describes a personal relationship management system called Monica, which allows users to document their lives, manage contacts, and organize interactions with friends and family. The actions identified are \""Collect\"" and \""Use\"" because the system gathers various types of data and utilizes it for specific purposes.  \n\nThe data types include contact information (name, phone number, email address, address) and personal details (date of birth, image). Additionally, biographical data such as notes and custom fields are collected for user-specific customization.  \n\nThe purposes of these actions are primarily for contact management, customization of the user experience, and functionality to enable features like reminders and diary entries.  \n\nThe stories are constructed to reflect how the system collects and uses this data to fulfill its intended purposes, such as managing relationships and providing personalized features.  \n</R>"""

# Password auth provider callbacks

Password auth providers offer a way for server administrators to integrate
their Synapse installation with an external authentication system. The callbacks can be
registered by using the Module API's `register_password_auth_provider_callbacks` method.

## Callbacks

### `auth_checkers`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
auth_checkers: Dict[Tuple[str, Tuple[str, ...]], Callable]
```

A dict mapping from tuples of a login type identifier (such as `m.login.password`) and a
tuple of field names (such as `(""password"", ""secret_thing"")`) to authentication checking
callbacks, which should be of the following form:

```python
async def check_auth(
    user: str,
    login_type: str,
    login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

The login type and field names should be provided by the user in the
request to the `/login` API. [The Matrix specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#authentication-types)
defines some types, however user defined ones are also allowed.

The callback is passed the `user` field provided by the client (which might not be in
`@username:server` form), the login type, and a dictionary of login secrets passed by
the client.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the
`/login` request. If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return `None`
instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

Note that the user is not automatically registered, the `register_user(..)` method of
the [module API](writing_a_module.html) can be used to lazily create users.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type but with different
fields, Synapse will refuse to start.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type with the same fields,
then the callbacks will be executed in order, until one returns a Matrix User ID (and
optionally a callback). In that case, the return value of that callback will be accepted
and subsequent callbacks will not be fired. If every callback returns `None`, then the
authentication fails.

### `check_3pid_auth`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def check_3pid_auth(
    medium: str, 
    address: str,
    password: str,
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

Called when a user attempts to register or log in with a third party identifier,
such as email. It is passed the medium (eg. `email`), an address (eg. `jdoe@example.com`)
and the user's password.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the `/login` request.
If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return None instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the authentication is denied.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password ) (p: Log out)
### `on_logged_out`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def on_logged_out(
    user_id: str,
    device_id: Optional[str],
    access_token: str
) -> None
``` 
Called during a logout request for a user. It is passed the qualified user ID, the ID of the
deactivated device (if any: access tokens are occasionally created without an associated
device ID), and the (now deactivated) access token.

Deleting the related pushers is done after calling `on_logged_out`, so you can rely on them
to still be present.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password, email ) (p: Account open)
### `get_username_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.52.0_

```python
async def get_username_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a username to set for the user
being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
username for this user. If a username is returned, it will be used as the local part of a
user's full Matrix ID (e.g. it's `alice` in `@alice:example.com`).

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration process.

The first dictionary contains the results of the [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
flow followed by the user. Its keys are the identifiers of every step involved in the flow,
associated with either a boolean value indicating whether the step was correctly completed,
or additional information (e.g. email address, phone number...). A list of most existing
identifiers can be found in the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#authentication-types).
Here's an example featuring all currently supported keys:

```python
{
    ""m.login.dummy"": True,  # Dummy authentication
    ""m.login.terms"": True,  # User has accepted the terms of service for the homeserver
    ""m.login.recaptcha"": True,  # User has completed the recaptcha challenge
    ""m.login.email.identity"": {  # User has provided and verified an email address
        ""medium"": ""email"",
        ""address"": ""alice@example.com"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.msisdn"": {  # User has provided and verified a phone number
        ""medium"": ""msisdn"",
        ""address"": ""33123456789"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.registration_token"": ""sometoken"",  # User has registered through a registration token
}
```

The second dictionary contains the parameters provided by the user's client in the request
to `/_matrix/client/v3/register`. See the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3register)
for a complete list of these parameters.

If the module cannot, or does not wish to, generate a username for this user, it must
return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username provided by the user is used, if any (otherwise one is automatically
generated).

### `get_displayname_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.54.0_

```python
async def get_displayname_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a display name to set for the
user being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
display name for this user.

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration use. These dictionaries are identical to the ones passed to
[`get_username_for_registration`](#get_username_for_registration), so refer to the
documentation of this callback for more information about them.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username will be used (e.g. `alice` if the user being registered is `@alice:example.com`).
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Phone number, email, username, password ) (p: Log in)
## `is_3pid_allowed`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.53.0_

```python
async def is_3pid_allowed(self, medium: str, address: str, registration: bool) -> bool
```

Called when attempting to bind a third-party identifier (i.e. an email address or a phone
number). The module is given the medium of the third-party identifier (which is `email` if
the identifier is an email address, or `msisdn` if the identifier is a phone number) and
its address, as well as a boolean indicating whether the attempt to bind is happening as
part of registering a new user. The module must return a boolean indicating whether the
identifier can be allowed to be bound to an account on the local homeserver.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `True`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `True` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback.

## Example

The example module below implements authentication checkers for two different login types: 
-  `my.login.type` 
    - Expects a `my_field` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_my_login`
- `m.login.password` (defined in [the spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#password-based))
    - Expects a `password` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_pass`

```python
from typing import Awaitable, Callable, Optional, Tuple

import synapse
from synapse import module_api


class MyAuthProvider:
    def __init__(self, config: dict, api: module_api):

        self.api = api

        self.credentials = {
            ""bob"": ""building"",
            ""@scoop:matrix.org"": ""digging"",
        }

        api.register_password_auth_provider_callbacks(
            auth_checkers={
                (""my.login_type"", (""my_field"",)): self.check_my_login,
                (""m.login.password"", (""password"",)): self.check_pass,
            },
        )

    async def check_my_login(
        self,
        username: str,
        login_type: str,
        login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
    ) -> Optional[
        Tuple[
            str,
            Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]],
        ]
    ]:
        if login_type != ""my.login_type"":
            return None

        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(""my_field""):
            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)

    async def check_pass(
        self,
        username: str,
        login_type: str,
        login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
    ) -> Optional[
        Tuple[
            str,
            Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]],
        ]
    ]:
        if login_type != ""m.login.password"":
            return None

        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(""password""):
            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)
```

I need to focus on actions, data types, purposes, and stories. Let me go through each section step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the callbacks like `auth_checkers` and `check_3pid_auth`, these seem to collect user credentials such as passwords and possibly email addresses. So the actions here would be Collect and Use because the system is gathering and then using the data to authenticate. The data types involved are Account Information, including User ID, Password, and Email address. The purpose is mainly for Authentication and Security.\n\nNext, the `on_logged_out` function handles logouts and uses access tokens. So the actions are Use, and the data types are Account Information like User ID and Access Token. The purpose here is Security and Functionality since it's managing session termination.\n\nThe `get_username_for_registration` and `get_displayname_for_registration` callbacks are about creating usernames and display names during registration. These would involve Collecting and Using data like Email, Phone Number, Username, etc. The purpose is Account Management and Functionality.\n\nFor the `is_3pid_allowed` function, it's checking if a third-party identifier can be bound. So actions are Use, data types are Email and Phone Number, and the purpose is Security and Functionality.\n\nLooking at the email and phone number addition processes, the actions are Collect when the user enters their email or phone number and Use when verifying. Data types are Email and Phone Number, with purposes of Authentication and Security.\n\nIn the removal sections, it's about deleting these identifiers, so actions are Use, data types are Email and Phone Number, purposes are Security and Functionality.\n\nPutting it all together, the stories should reflect how data is collected and used for authentication, account management, and security. Each story ties together the action, data, and purpose in a concise narrative.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Collect, Use</Actions>  \n<Data Types>Account Information, Email address, Phone number</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>Authentication, Security</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \nWe collect account information, email address, and phone number for authentication.

Let me go through the text step by step to identify each category.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text to understand the context. It's about Matrix Synapse's password authentication provider callbacks, specifically handling third-party identifiers like email and phone numbers. The document outlines various callbacks and processes for adding, removing, and verifying these identifiers.\n\nStarting with the callbacks:\n\n1. **auth_checkers**: This section describes how authentication modules can be registered. It mentions handling login types and fields like passwords. So, the actions here are collecting and using account information, specifically passwords and usernames. The purpose would be for authentication and account management.\n\n2. **check_3pid_auth**: This callback deals with third-party identifiers such as email. It collects the medium (like email), address, and password. The actions are collect and use, data types include email and password, and the purpose is authentication.\n\n3. **on_logged_out**: This is triggered during logout. It uses the user ID, device ID, and access token. The action is using account information for security purposes.\n\n4. **get_username_for_registration and get_displayname_for_registration**: These callbacks are about user registration. They collect information like email and phone numbers during the registration process. The purpose here is account creation and management.\n\nMoving on to the section about adding and removing threePIDs (third-party identifiers):\n\n- **Adding Email**: The user provides an email, which is then verified via a token. The actions are collecting email and usage for verification. Data types include email and phone numbers, with purposes of account management and functionality.\n\n- **User Receives Email**: They click a link, which involves using their email for verification. The purpose is to secure the account.\n\n- **Entering Password**: The user enters their password to confirm. Actions are using password data for authentication.\n\n- **Removing Email/Phone Number**: The user removes a third-party ID. Actions involve using account information to manage the account.\n\nIn each of these sections, the common actions are collect and use, with data types being account information, email, phone number, and password. The purposes consistently revolve around functionality, account management, security, and authentication.\n\nFor the stories, I'll format them to reflect how actions, data types, and purposes interact. Each story should clearly state the action, the data involved, and the purpose.\n\nI need to ensure that I only use the specified categories and avoid adding any new ones. Also, each annotation should be concise and directly tied to the text.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Collect, Use</Actions>\n<Data Types>Account Information, Email Address, Phone Number, Password</Data Types>\n<Purposes>Authentication, Account Management, Security, Functionality</Purposes>\n<Stories>\n1.

Getting Started
Choosing an Instance
If you are used to sites like Reddit, then Lemmy works in a fundamentally different way. Instead of a single website like reddit.com, there are many different websites (called instances). These are operated by different people, have different topics and rules. Nevertheless, posts created in one instance can directly be seen by users who are registered on another. Its basically like email, but for social media.

This means before using Lemmy and registering an account, you need to pick an instance. For this you can browse the instance list and look for one that matches your topics of interest. You can also see if the rules match your expectations, and how many users there are. It is better to avoid very big or very small instances. But don't worry too much about this choice, you can always create another account on a different instance later.

[instance list screenshot]

Registration
Once you choose an instance, it's time to create your account. To do this, click sign up in the top right of the page, or click the top right button on mobile to open a menu with sign up link.

[registration page screenshot]

On the signup page you need to enter a few things:

Username: How do you want to be called? This name can not be changed and is unique within an instance. Later you can also set a displayname which can be freely changed. If your desired username is taken, consider choosing a different instance where it is still available.
Email: Your email address. This is used for password resets and notifications (if enabled). Providing an email address is usually optional, but admins may choose to make it mandatory. In this case you will have to wait for a confirmation mail and click the link after completing this form.
Password: The password for logging in to your account. Make sure to choose a long and unique password which isn't used on any other website.
Verify password: Repeat the same password from above to ensure that it was entered correctly.
There are also a few optional fields, which you may need to fill in depending on the instance configuration:

Question/Answer: Instance admins can set an arbitrary question which needs to be answered in order to create an account. This is often used to prevent spam bots from signing up. After submitting the form, you will need to wait for some time until the answer is approved manually before you can login.
Code: A captcha which is easy to solve for humans but hard for bots. Enter the letters and numbers that you see in the text box, ignoring uppercase or lowercase. Click the refresh button if you are unable to read a character. The play button plays an audio version of the captcha.
Show NSFW content: Here you can choose if content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only) should be shown.
When you are done, press the sign up button.

It depends on the instance configuration when you can login and start using the account. In case the email is mandatory, you need to wait for the confirmation email and click the link first. In case ""Question/Answer"" is present, you need to wait for an admin to manually review and approve your registration. If you have problems with the registration, try to get in contact with the admin for support. You can also choose a different instance to sign up if your primary choice does not work.

Following Communities
After logging in to your new account, its time to follow communities that you are interested in. For this you can click on the communities link at the top of the page (on mobile, you need to click the menu icon on the top right first). You will see a list of communities which can be filtered by subscribed, local or all. Local communities are those which are hosted on the same site where you are signed in, while all also contains federated communities from other instances. In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.

Another way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the ""sidebar"" button on mobile.

These previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.

Setting up Your Profile
Before you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to ""settings"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:

Displayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time
Bio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown
Matrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat
Avatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts
Banner: A header image for your profile page
On this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:

Blocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.
Interface language: Which language the user interface should use.
Languages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select ""Undetermined"" to see them.
Theme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.
Type: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.
Sort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.
Show NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only).
Show Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.
Show Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.
Bot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically
Show Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.
Show Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.
Show Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.
Send notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.
Start Posting
Finally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.

Other than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as ""not safe for work"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.

One more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them:

Registration
---

Not all Friendica sites allow open registration.
If registration is allowed, you will see a ""Register"" link immediately below the login prompt on the site's home page.
Following this link will take you to the site registration page.
The strength of our network is that lots of different sites are all completely compatible with each other.
If the site you're visiting doesn't allow registration, or you think you might prefer another one, there is a [list of public servers here](https://dir.friendica.social/servers) and hopefully you will find one that meets your needs.

If you'd like to have your own server, you can do that too.
Visit [the Friendica website](http://friendi.ca/) to download the code with setup instructions.
It's a very simple installation process that anybody experienced in hosting websites, or with basic Linux experience can handle easily.

### OpenID

The first field on the Registration page is for an OpenID address.
If you do not have an OpenID address or do not wish to use OpenID, leave this field blank.
If you have an OpenID account elsewhere and wish to use it, enter the address into this field and click 'Register'.
Friendica will attempt to extract as much information as possible from your OpenID provider and return to this page with those items already filled in.

### Your Display Name

Please provide your display name **as you would like it to be displayed on this system**.
Some people use their real name for this, but you're under no obligation to do so yourself.

### Email Address

Please provide a valid email address.
Your email address is **never** published.
We need this to send you account information and your login details.
You may also occasionally receive notifications of incoming messages or items requiring your attention, but you have the possibility to completely disable these from your Settings page once you have logged in.
This doesn't have to be your primary email address, but it does need to be a real email address.
You can't get your initial password, or reset a lost password later without it.
This is the only bit of personal information that has to be accurate.

### Nickname

A nickname is used to generate web addresses for many of your personal pages, and is also treated like an email address when establishing communications with others.
Due to the way that the nickname is used, it has some limitations.
It must contain only US-ASCII text characters and numbers, and must also start with a text character.
It also must be unique on this system.
This is used in many places to identify your account, and once set it cannot be changed.


### Directory Publishing

The registration form also allows you to choose whether or not to list your account in the online directory of your node.
This is like a ""phone book"" and you may choose to be unlisted.
We recommend that you select 'Yes' so that other people (friends, family, etc.) will be able to find you.
If you choose 'No', you will essentially be invisible and have few opportunities for interaction.
Whichever you choose, this can be changed any time from your Settings page after you login.

### Register

Once you have provided the necessary details, click the 'Register' button.
An email will be sent to you providing your account login details.
Please check your email (including spam folders) for your registration details and initial password.

Login Page
---

On the 'Login' page, please enter your login information that was provided during registration.
You may use either your nickname or email address as a Login Name.

If you use your account to manage other accounts and these all have the same email address, please enter the nickname for the account you wish to manage.

If your account has been OpenID enabled, you may use your OpenID address as a login name and leave the password blank.
You will be redirected to your OpenID provider to complete your authorisation.

Otherwise, enter your password.
This will have been initially provided in your registration email message.
Your password is case-sensitive, so please check your 'Caps Lock' key if you are having difficulty logging in.

Changing Your Password
---

After your first login, please visit the 'Settings' page from the top menu bar and change your password to something that you will remember.

Getting Started
---

A link with ['Tips for New Members'](newmember) will show up on your network and home pages for two weeks providing key information for getting started.

Retrieving Personal Data
---

You can export a copy of your personal data in JSON format from the ""Export personal data"" link at the top of your settings page.

You need this file to relocate your Friendica account to another node.
This might be necessary, e.g. if your node suffers a severe hardware problem and is not recoverable.

you're visiting doesn't allow registration, or you think you might prefer another one, there is a [list of public servers here](https://dir.friendica.social/servers) and hopefully you will find one that meets your needs.\n\nIf you'd like to have your own server, you can do that too.\nVisit [the Friendica website](http://friendi.ca/) to download the code with setup instructions.\nIt's a very simple installation process that anybody experienced in hosting websites, or with basic Linux experience can handle easily.\n\n### OpenID\n\nThe first field on the Registration page is for an OpenID address.\nIf you do not have an OpenID address or do not wish to use OpenID, leave this field blank.\nIf you have an OpenID account elsewhere and wish to use it, enter the address into this field and click 'Register'.\nFriendica will attempt to extract as much information as possible from your OpenID provider and return to this page with those items already filled in.\n\n### Your Display Name\n\nPlease provide your display name **as you would like it to be displayed on this system**.\nSome people use their real name for this, but you're under no obligation to do so yourself.\n\n### Email Address\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nYour email address is **never** published.\nWe need this to send you account information and your login details.\nYou may also occasionally receive notifications of incoming messages or items requiring your attention, but you have the possibility to completely disable these from your Settings page once you have logged in.\nThis doesn't have to be your primary email address, but it does need to be a real email address.\nYou can't get your initial password, or reset a lost password later without it.\nThis is the only bit of personal information that has to be accurate.\n\n### Nickname\n\nA nickname is used to generate web addresses for many of your personal pages, and is also treated like an email address when establishing communications with others.\nDue to the way that the nickname is used, it has some limitations.\nIt must contain only US-ASCII text characters and numbers, and must also start with a text character.\nIt also must be unique on this system.\nThis is used in many places to identify your account, and once set it cannot be changed.\n\n\n### Directory Publishing\n\nThe registration form also allows you to choose whether or not to list your account in the online directory of your node.\nThis is like a \""phone book\"" and you may choose to be unlisted.\nWe recommend that you select 'Yes' so that other people (friends, family, etc.) will be able to find you.\nIf you choose 'No', you will essentially be invisible and have few opportunities for interaction.\nWhichever you choose, this can be changed any time from your Settings page after you login.\n\n### Register\n\nOnce you have provided the necessary details, click the 'Register' button.\nAn email will be sent to you providing your account login details.\nPlease check your email (including spam folders) for your registration details and initial password.\n\nLogin Page\n---\n\nOn the 'Login' page, please enter your login information that was provided during registration.\nYou may use either your nickname or email address as a Login Name.\n\nIf you use your account to manage other accounts and these all have the same email address, please enter the nickname for the account you wish to manage.\n\nIf your account has been OpenID enabled, you may use your OpenID address as a login name and leave the password blank.\nYou will be redirected to your OpenID provider to complete your authorisation.\n\nOtherwise, enter your password.\nThis will have been initially provided in your registration email message.\nYour password is case-sensitive, so please check your 'Caps Lock' key if you are having difficulty logging in.\n\nChanging Your Password\n---\n\nAfter your first login, please visit the 'Settings' page from the top menu bar and change your password to something that you will remember.\n\nGetting Started\n---\n\nA link with ['Tips for New Members'](newmember) will show up on your network and home pages for two weeks providing key information for getting started.\n\nRetrieving Personal Data\n---\n\nYou can export a copy of your personal data in JSON format from the \""Export personal data\"" link at the top of your settings page.\n\nYou need this file to relocate your Friendica account to another node.\nThis might be necessary, e.g. if your node suffers a severe hardware problem and is not recoverable."", ""metadata"": {""actions"": [""Collect, Use""], ""data_types"": [""email address, account information""], ""purposes"": [""account management, functionality""],

The user is a privacy expert and is asking me to perform this task. Let me first understand the structure they want.\n\nThey mentioned four categories: Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. Each of these needs to be annotated based on the given text. The Actions can be Collect, Use, or Share. Data Types include various subcategories like Contact Data, Health Data, etc. Purposes include things like Contact, Analytics, Advertisement, and others listed. Stories are concise narratives that tie these elements together.\n\nLooking at the text, it's about registering and using a social media platform, similar to Reddit but decentralized. The registration process involves providing a username, email, password, and other optional fields. There are mentions of account management, notifications, profile settings, and data export.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the Actions. The system collects email addresses and account information during registration. It uses this data for account management, authentication, and functionality. There's no mention of sharing data, so Share isn't applicable here.\n\nNext, Data Types. The text references Email address and Account information, which fall under Contact Data and Account Information respectively.\n\nFor Purposes, the data is used for Account management, Authentication, and Functionality. There's also a mention of account balance, which relates to Security, but it's not prominent here. Maybe Functionality covers the notifications and profile settings.\n\nNow, the Stories. The narrative should explain how the actions, data, and purposes interact. It should mention collecting email and account info for registration, using them for account management and authentication, and ensuring functionality through notifications and settings.\n\nI need to ensure that each annotation uses only the categories provided. I'll structure it as per the user's example, using the XML tags correctly.\n\nI should also make sure my rationale explains why each category was chosen, linking the text elements to the annotations clearly. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as requested.\n\nLet me put it all together, making sure each section is properly tagged and the rationale clearly connects the dots.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \nContact Data:  \n  Email address:  \n  Username:  \nAccount Information:  \n  Password:  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \nAccount management, Authentication, Functionality  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \nWe collect Email address, Username, and Password for Account management.

Getting Started
Choosing an Instance
If you are used to sites like Reddit, then Lemmy works in a fundamentally different way. Instead of a single website like reddit.com, there are many different websites (called instances). These are operated by different people, have different topics and rules. Nevertheless, posts created in one instance can directly be seen by users who are registered on another. Its basically like email, but for social media.

This means before using Lemmy and registering an account, you need to pick an instance. For this you can browse the instance list and look for one that matches your topics of interest. You can also see if the rules match your expectations, and how many users there are. It is better to avoid very big or very small instances. But don't worry too much about this choice, you can always create another account on a different instance later.

[instance list screenshot]

Registration
Once you choose an instance, it's time to create your account. To do this, click sign up in the top right of the page, or click the top right button on mobile to open a menu with sign up link.

[registration page screenshot]

On the signup page you need to enter a few things:

Username: How do you want to be called? This name can not be changed and is unique within an instance. Later you can also set a displayname which can be freely changed. If your desired username is taken, consider choosing a different instance where it is still available.
Email: Your email address. This is used for password resets and notifications (if enabled). Providing an email address is usually optional, but admins may choose to make it mandatory. In this case you will have to wait for a confirmation mail and click the link after completing this form.
Password: The password for logging in to your account. Make sure to choose a long and unique password which isn't used on any other website.
Verify password: Repeat the same password from above to ensure that it was entered correctly.
There are also a few optional fields, which you may need to fill in depending on the instance configuration:

Question/Answer: Instance admins can set an arbitrary question which needs to be answered in order to create an account. This is often used to prevent spam bots from signing up. After submitting the form, you will need to wait for some time until the answer is approved manually before you can login.
Code: A captcha which is easy to solve for humans but hard for bots. Enter the letters and numbers that you see in the text box, ignoring uppercase or lowercase. Click the refresh button if you are unable to read a character. The play button plays an audio version of the captcha.
Show NSFW content: Here you can choose if content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only) should be shown.
When you are done, press the sign up button.

It depends on the instance configuration when you can login and start using the account. In case the email is mandatory, you need to wait for the confirmation email and click the link first. In case ""Question/Answer"" is present, you need to wait for an admin to manually review and approve your registration. If you have problems with the registration, try to get in contact with the admin for support. You can also choose a different instance to sign up if your primary choice does not work.

Following Communities
After logging in to your new account, its time to follow communities that you are interested in. For this you can click on the communities link at the top of the page (on mobile, you need to click the menu icon on the top right first). You will see a list of communities which can be filtered by subscribed, local or all. Local communities are those which are hosted on the same site where you are signed in, while all also contains federated communities from other instances. In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.

Another way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the ""sidebar"" button on mobile.

These previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.

Setting up Your Profile
Before you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to ""settings"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:

Displayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time
Bio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown
Matrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat
Avatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts
Banner: A header image for your profile page
On this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:

Blocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.
Interface language: Which language the user interface should use.
Languages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select ""Undetermined"" to see them.
Theme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.
Type: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.
Sort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.
Show NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only).
Show Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.
Show Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.
Bot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically
Show Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.
Show Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.
Show Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.
Send notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.
Start Posting
Finally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.

Other than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as ""not safe for work"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.

One more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them:

We use email address and account information for functionality.. </Stories># New Account Sign-Ups

If you want to allow more people than just you to have an account on your instance, you can open your instance to new account sign-ups / registrations.

Be wary that as instance admin, like it or not, you are responsible for what people post on your instance. If users on your instance harass or annoy other people on the fediverse, you may find your instance gets a bad reputation and becomes blocked by others. Moderating a space properly takes work. As such, you should carefully consider whether or not you are willing and able to do moderation, and consider accepting sign-ups on your instance only from friends and people that you really trust.

!!! warning
    For the sign-up flow to work as intended, your instance [should be configured to send emails](../configuration/smtp.md).
    
    As mentioned below, several emails are sent during the sign-up flow, both to you (as admin/moderator) and to the applicant, including an email asking them to confirm their email address.
    
    If they cannot receive this email (because your instance is not configured to send emails), you will have to manually confirm the account by [using the CLI tool](../admin/cli.md#gotosocial-admin-account-confirm).

## Opening Sign-Ups

You can open new account sign-ups for your instance by changing the variable `accounts-registration-open` to `true` in your [configuration](../configuration/accounts.md), and restarting your GoToSocial instance.

A sign-up form for your instance will be available at the `/signup` endpoint. For example, `https://your-instance.example.org/signup`.

![Sign-up form, showing email, password, username, and reason fields.](../public/signup-form.png)

Also, your instance homepage and ""about"" pages will be updated to reflect that registrations are open.

When someone submits a new sign-up, they'll receive an email at the provided email address, giving them a link to confirm that the address really belongs to them.

In the meantime, admins and moderators on your instance will receive an email and a notification that a new sign-up has been submitted.

## Handling Sign-Ups

Instance admins and moderators can handle a new sign-up by either approving or rejecting it via the ""accounts"" -> ""pending"" section in the admin panel.

![Admin settings panel open to ""accounts"" -> ""pending"", showing one account in a list.](../public/signup-pending.png)

If you have no sign-ups, the list pictured above will be empty. If you have a pending account sign-up, however, you can click on it to open that account in the account details screen:

![Details of a new pending account, giving options to approve or reject the sign-up.](../public/signup-account.png)

At the bottom, you will find actions that let you approve or reject the sign-up.

If you **approve** the sign-up, the account will be marked as ""approved"", and an email will be sent to the applicant informing them their sign-up has been approved, and reminding them to confirm their email address if they haven't already done so. If they have already confirmed their email address, they will be able to log in and start using their account.

If you **reject** the sign-up, you may wish to inform the applicant that their sign-up has been rejected, which you can do by ticking the ""send email"" checkbox. This will send a short email to the applicant informing them of the rejection. If you wish, you can add a custom message, which will be added at the bottom of the email. You can also add a private note that will be visible to other admins only.

!!! warning
    You may want to hold off on approving a sign-up until they have confirmed their email address, in case the applicant made a typo when submitting, or the email address they provided does not actually belong to them. If they cannot confirm their email address, they will not be able to log in and use their account.

## Sign-Up Limits

To avoid sign-up backlogs overwhelming admins and moderators, GoToSocial limits the sign-up pending backlog to 20 accounts. Once there are 20 accounts pending in the backlog waiting to be handled by an admin or moderator, new sign-ups will not be accepted via the form.

New sign-ups will also not be accepted via the form if 10 or more new account sign-ups have been approved in the last 24 hours, to avoid instances rapidly expanding beyond the capabilities of moderators.

In both cases, applicants will be shown an error message explaining why they could not submit the form, and inviting them to try again later.

To combat spam accounts, GoToSocial account sign-ups **always** require manual approval by an administrator, and applicants must **always** confirm their email address before they are able to log in and post.

## Sign-Up Via Invite

NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: in a future update, admins and moderators will be able to create and send invites that allow accounts to be created even when public sign-up is closed, and to pre-approve accounts created via invitation, and/or allow them to override the sign-up limits described above.

Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand what's going on.\n\nSo, the text is about setting up an account on Lemmy, which is a decentralized social media platform. It explains how to choose an instance, register an account, fill in the required information like username, email, password, and other optional fields. It also talks about setting up a profile, following communities, posting, and handling sign-ups from an admin perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the actions mentioned. The actions listed in the categories are Collect, Use, and Share. I see that during registration, the system collects data like username, email, password, and other optional fields such as answers to questions or CAPTCHA. So, the action here is Collect.\n\nNext, the data types. The primary data types involved are Email address and Account information, which include username and password. There are also mentions of optional fields like questions/answers and CAPTCHA, which might fall under other categories, but the main ones are Email address and Account information.\n\nNow, the purposes. The text mentions that the email is used for password resets and notifications, which relates to Account management and Functionality. The username and password are used for Authentication. So, the purposes are Account management, Functionality, and Authentication.\n\nPutting it together, the story would be about collecting email and account information for managing accounts, using them for functionality, and authenticating users. This makes sense because without collecting this data, the platform can't function properly or secure user accounts.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm using only the categories provided. So, no extra actions or data types beyond what's listed. The purposes should also align with the given options, which they do here.\n\nI think that's a solid breakdown. Now, I'll format it as per the instructions with the XML tags and include my rationale after the <R> tag.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Collect, Use</Actions>  \n<Data Types>Email address, Account Information</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>Account management, Functionality, Authentication</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \nWe collect Email address and Account Information for Account management.

We use Email address and Account Information for Authentication.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \nThe text describes the process of registering an account on Lemmy, which involves collecting user data such as Email address and Account Information (e.g., username, password). These data types are collected for the purposes of Account management (e.g., creating and managing user accounts), Functionality (e.g., enabling notifications and password resets), and Authentication (e.g., verifying user identity and securing login). The stories capture how these actions, data types, and purposes interact to facilitate user registration and account functionality on the platform.  \n</R>""","""<think>\nOkay, so I've been given this task to annotate a text about Lemmy instance registration with specific metadata. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure. The text is divided into sections like Getting Started, Choosing an Instance, Registration, Following Communities, Setting up Your Profile, Start Posting, and then some admin sections about handling sign-ups. \n\nLooking at the registration part, it mentions entering a username, email, password, and some optional fields like a question/answer and a CAPTCHA. So, actions here would involve collecting this data. The data types include things like Email address, Username, Password, etc. The purposes seem to be for account management, authentication, and functionality.\n\nIn the admin section, the instance admins collect sign-up data, use it to approve or reject accounts, and share notifications via email. Data types here would be Email address and Account information. Purposes include account management, security, and functionality.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only using the predefined categories. For actions, it's Collect, Use, Share. Data types include Contact Data (like Email, Username), Account Information (Password), and maybe others. Purposes are things like Account Management, Authentication, Functionality, Security.\n\nI'll go through each section, identify where data is being collected, used, or shared. Then map those to the appropriate categories. For example, when a user enters their email and password, that's Collect action for Contact Data and Account Information, used for Authentication.\n\nIn the admin part, they collect sign-up data, which is Contact Data and Account Info, and use it for Account Management and Security purposes. They also share emails for notifications, so that's a Share action.\n\nI think I have a handle on it now. I'll structure the annotations accordingly, making sure each part is correctly categorized and explained.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>\n  Collect, Use, Share\n</Actions>\n<Data Types>\n  Email address, Username, Password, Account information\n</Data Types>\n<Purposes>\n  Account management, Authentication, Functionality, Security\n</Purposes>\n<Stories>\n  1.

These data types are used for account management, authentication, and functionality. The purposes include ensuring that users can create and manage their accounts securely, verifying identities through email confirmation, and enabling users to interact with the platform's features. The stories highlight how the platform collects and uses this data to provide a functional and secure user experience.\n\nThe admin section discusses how instance admins handle sign-ups, collect sign-up data, and use this data to approve or reject accounts.

Manage Users & Auth
Registrations
You can enable registrations of on your instance. To prevent SPAM, we recommend to enable to following signup settings:

Require email verification
Require approval
Registration approval PeerTube >= 5.1
If signup require approval, users will request registration on your instance and will have to fill a Registration reason to help you to decide if you want to accept or not the user.

Registration reason input

Administrators and moderators can then list registration requests on the instance.

Registration list table

And accept or reject them. A Moderation response must be filled that will be sent to the user to explain its registration request has been accepted/rejected.

Accepting a registration will automatically create the user.

Registration accept modal

Manage users
The user menu allows you to manage all existing users on your instance.

Window displayed when in user menu

Users will be created when they register to your instance, but you may also create users manually using the ""create user"" button at the top right of the user menu.

Under the user menu you can update or delete a user by clicking on the three dots  at the left of a user info.

User dot button

Edit user will allow you to update user informations - see below.
Delete user will allow you to definitely delete this user. All of that user's videos will also be deleted.
Ban will disable connection for this user but videos and comments will be kept as is. No one else will be able to register with the same nickname or email address.
Editing users
When clicking on Edit, you can update parameters for a user such as email, role, video quota and so on. You also can specify if it needs review before a video goes public.

Window displayed when clicking on Edit user

You have two ways to reset password:

by sending a reset link to the user email
by changing it manually
Roles
Role defines what a user is allowed to do on the instance. There are three roles on PeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User.

Administrator
Administrators can do anything, and have access to the full admin backend.

Add, Remove, and Edit user accounts, including Admin and Moderator accounts
View, Edit, Add and Remove instance following and followers

Moderators can also do anything that a User account can do.

User
User is the default role.

Create, Edit, and Delete channels associated with their account
Create, Edit, and Delete playlists associated with their account
Upload, Edit, and Delete videos to their account, associated with one of their channels
Comment on videos
Add videos to playlists, or remove videos from them
Change user settings (See the Use PeerTube page for more information)
Report videos to the moderators with a comment about why the video is being reported
Quotas
Video Quota
Video Quota represents the size limit a user cannot exceed when uploading videos. Each time a user upload a video, Peertube checks if there is enough quota to store it. If not, the upload is denied. Beware, the quota after an upload is estimated only on the size of the file uploaded. However, after transcoding (which outputs videos of unpredictable size) the video resolutions resulting of the transcoding are also taken into account in a user's quota. If you have enabled multiple resolutions, a user can use more than their quota on disk. Peertube will provide you an estimation of maximal space a user will use according to your transcoding options. You can change the default for new users in the configuration menu.

Daily Video Quota
Daily Video Quota represents the max quota a user is allowed to upload by day. You can tune this parameter to adjust the resources your instance will use. For instance, if you have many users transcoding could take a long time, so limiting upload by user by day could help to share resources between them. You can change the default for new users in the configuration menu.

Once you are satisfied with your user, you can click on the ""Update User"" button to save modifications.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them: 
Privacy stories are built explicitly from our labelled privacy behaviors in the format of we (action) (data type) for (purpose)<Actions> Collect, use </Actions> <Data Types> Email address, account information </Data Types> <Purposes> account management, user protection </Purposes>1. We collect email address, account information for account management. We  use email address, account information  for user protection.. </Stories>User Details
The User Details section covers account settings for the currently logged in user. A user's details help identify them among your team, help your teammates contact each other, and is relevant in Invoice Ninja if you are assigning users to tasks, projects, clients, or etc as a practice for organization and accountability.

Details
First Name
Last Name
Email - Used to send password reset links to when requested.
Phone - For your reference only.
Password - You would use this field to change your user account password, it doesn't reveal your existing account password.
Enable Two Factor - Enable two factor authentication using TOTP codes with any TOTP supported 2FA app or device. The pop-up will present a random secret code, and a matching QR code for it. It will require you test the TOTP with a one time password to verify the 2FA setup works, then save the change to your account.
Accent Color - Accent colors are used mostly as selection highlighter, and button colors in the admin portal UI. Accent Color is a mix of user-associated, and company associated. Each user may pick all of their own accent colors, and for each company.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully to understand the context. It's about managing users and authentication on a platform, specifically Peertube. The text describes how administrators can manage user registrations, roles, and various settings.\n\nLooking for actions, I see words like \""enable,\"" \""require,\"" \""fill,\"" \""list,\"" \""accept,\"" \""reject,\"" \""create,\"" \""update,\"" \""delete,\"" \""ban,\"" \""reset,\"" \""send,\"" and \""configure.\"" These correspond to the actions Collect, Use, and Share.\n\nNext, for Data Types, I'll identify the specific data mentioned. The text refers to email addresses, user IDs, registration reasons, user information, passwords, roles, video quotas, names, phone numbers, and two-factor authentication details. These fit into categories like Contact Data, Account Information, and Security Data.\n\nNow, the Purposes. The text discusses managing user accounts, preventing spam, moderating registrations, security measures like two-factor authentication, and customizing user settings. These align with purposes such as Security, Functionality, Account Management, User Protection, and Customization.\n\nFor the Stories, I need to create concise scenarios that tie together actions, data types, and purposes. For example, collecting email addresses for account management, using email for password resets, and managing user roles for security.\n\nI'll structure the annotations using the specified XML tags, ensuring each category is properly filled. Then, I'll explain my rationale for each choice, making sure to connect the text elements with the categories accurately.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use, Share  \n</Actions>  \n\n<Data Types>  \nContact Data:  \n  Email address:  \n  Phone Number:  \n  Name:  \nAccount Information:  \n  User id:  \n  Username:  \n  Password:  \n  Account Balance:  \n  Messages:  \n  Friends:  \n</Data Types>  \n\n<Purposes>  \nSecurity, Functionality, Accounts, Requirements  \n</Purposes>  \n\n<Stories>  \n1.

The system collects email addresses and passwords during registration to create and manage user accounts securely.  \n2. The system uses email addresses to send password reset links and verify user identities, ensuring account security.  \n3. The system shares account information between administrators and moderators to manage user access and enforce security policies.""","""<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to annotate this text properly. Let me start by reading through the provided text to understand what's going on. \n\nThe text seems to be about managing users and authentication on a platform called PeerTube. It talks about user registrations, different roles like Administrators, Moderators, and Users, and various settings related to user accounts. There's also a section about user details, including first name, last name, email, phone, password, and two-factor authentication.\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to annotate this text with specific metadata categories: Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. They've given me a list of possible values for each category, so I need to make sure I only use those.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the actions mentioned in the text. The actions are things like enabling registrations, requiring email verification, accepting or rejecting registrations, creating users manually, updating user information, deleting users, banning users, resetting passwords, and managing roles. From the provided actions list, these correspond to \""Collect,\"" \""Use,\"" and \""Share.\"" I think \""Collect\"" would apply to gathering user data during registration. \""Use\"" would be when the system processes this data for account management or security purposes. I don't see any sharing of data with third parties, so maybe \""Share\"" isn't applicable here.\n\nNext, the data types. The text mentions email addresses, phone numbers, passwords, user IDs, roles, and possibly others like names. Looking at the data types list, these fit under Contact Data (email, phone, name), Account Information (user ID, password, account balance), and maybe Biographical Data if names are considered. I don't see any health or financial data here, so those categories can be ignored.\n\nNow, purposes. The purposes are the reasons behind the actions. The text talks about preventing spam through email verification, managing user accounts, security through two-factor authentication, and assigning roles to users. So the purposes would likely be Security, Account Management, Functionality, and User Protection. I don't see elements related to advertising or analytics, so those can be left out.\n\nFor the stories, I need to create concise narratives that tie actions, data types, and purposes together. For example, the system collects email addresses for account management and security. Administrators use account information to manage user roles. Users provide details for account functionality and security.\n\nI should make sure each story clearly connects an action, the data involved, and the purpose. I also need to explain why I chose each annotation in the rationale section, linking back to the text.\n\nWait, I should double-check if all the data types I identified are covered in the provided list. For example, names are part of Contact Data as subcategories. Also, roles are part of Account Information. I think I covered all relevant data types without including any that aren't mentioned.\n\nIn the purposes, I used Security for things like two-factor authentication and preventing unauthorized access. Account Management and Functionality cover the administrative tasks and user settings. User Protection ties into preventing spam and managing user access.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll structure the annotations accordingly, making sure each category is properly filled with the relevant information from the text. Then, I'll provide a clear rationale explaining each choice based on the content.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Collect, Use, Share</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \n  Contact Data:  \n    Email address:  \n    Phone Number:  \n    Name:  \n  Account Information:  \n    User ID:  \n    Password:  \n    Account Balance:  \n  Biographical Data:  \n    CV:  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>Security, Functionality, Account Management, User Protection</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n1.

Edit on GitHub
Navigation
The Desktop App exercises relatively strict control over the userâ€™s ability to navigate through the web. This is done for a few reasons:
Security:
Since we expose certain Electron (and therefore NodeJS) APIs to the front-end application, we want to be in control of what scripts are run in the front-end. We make a concerted effort to lock down the exposed APIs to only what is necessary; however, to avoid any privacy or security breaches, itâ€™s best to avoid allowing the user to navigate to any page that isnâ€™t explicitly trusted.
User Experience:
Our application is ONLY designed to work with the Mattermost Web App and thus allowing the user to navigate to other places that are not the Web App is not a supported use case, and could create some undesirable effects.
Internal navigation
The Mattermost Web App is self-contained, with the majority of links provided by
react-router
and thus most navigation is handled by that module. However, in the Desktop App, we have a major feature that allows users to navigate between distinct tabs bound to the same server. There are two ways that this style of navigation happens in the Web App:
A user clicks on a link provided by the
react-router
Link
component
The application calls
browserHistory.push
directly within the Web App based on the user action
Both of these methods will make use of the
browserHistory
module within the Web App.
When one of the above methods is used, normally the Web App would update the browserâ€™s URL and change the state of the page. In the Desktop App, we instead send the arguments of the call to
browserHistory.push
up to the Electron Main Process. The information is received at the method
WindowManager.handleBrowserHistoryPush
, where we perform the following actions:
Clean the path name by removing any part of the serverâ€™s subpath pathname.
When the arguments are sent up to the Desktop App, it includes the subpath of the server hosting it.
As an example, if the server URL is
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, any path that is received will start with
/mattermost
and we will need to remove that component. The same would be true for any other path following the origin
http://server-1.com
.
Retrieve the view matching the path name
After removing the leading subpath (if applicable), we check to see if a portion of the path matches one of the other tabs, signally that we will need to switch to that tab.
For server
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, if the pathname is
/mattermost/boards/board1
, we would get the
Boards
view matching the server.
Display the correct view and send the cleaned path to its renderer process
We then explicitly display the new view if itâ€™s not currently in focus. If itâ€™s closed, we open it and load the corresponding URL with the provided path.
Exception
: If weâ€™re redirecting to the root of the application and the user is not logged in, it will generate an unnecessary refresh. In this case, we do not send the path name down.
External navigation
For the cases where a user wants to navigate away from the Web App to an external site, we generally want to direct the user outside of the Desktop App and have them open their default web browser and use the external site in that application.
In order to achieve this, we need to explicitly handle every other link and method of navigation that is available to an Electron renderer process. Fortunately, Electron provides a few listeners that help us with that:
will-navigate
is an event that fires when the URL is changed for a given renderer process. Attaching a listener for this event allows us to prevent the navigation if desired.
NOTE: The event will not fire for in-page navigations or updating
window.location.hash
.
did-start-navigation
is another renderer process event that will fire once the page has started navigating. We can use this event to perform any actions when a certain URL is visited.
new-window
is an event that will fire when the user tries to open a new window or tab. This commonly will fire when the user clicks on a link marked
target=_blank
. We attach this listener using the
setWindowOpenHandler
and will allow us to
allow
or
deny
the opening as we desire.
In our application, we define all of these listeners in the
webContentEvents
module, and we attach them whenever a new
webContents
object is create to make sure that all renderer processes are correctly secured and set up correctly.
New window handling
Our new window handler will
deny
the opening of a new Electron window if any of the following cases are true:
Malformed URL:
Depending on the case, it will outright ignore it (if the URL could not be parsed), or it will open the userâ€™s default browser if it is somehow invalid in another way.
Untrusted Protocol:
If the URL does not match an allowed protocol (allowed protocols include
http
,
https
, and any other protocol that was explicitly allowed by the user).
In this case, it will ask the user whether the protocol should be allowed, and if so will open the URL in the userâ€™s default application that corresponds to that protocol.
Unknown Site:
If the URL does not match the root of a configured server, it will always try to open the link in the userâ€™s default browser.
If the URL DOES match the root of a configured server, we still will deny the window opening for a few cases:
If the URL matches the public files route (
/api/v4/public/files/*
)
If the URL matches the image proxy route (
/api/v4/image/*
)
If the URL matches the help route (
/help/*
)
For these cases, we will open the link in the userâ€™s browser.
Deep Link Case
: If the URL doesnâ€™t match any of the above routes, but is still a valid configured server, we will generally treat is as the deep link cause, and will instead attempt to show the correct tab as well as navigate to the corresponding URL within the app.
There are two cases where we do allow the application to open a new window:
If the URL matches the
devtools:
protocol, so that we can open the Chrome Developer Tools.
If the URL is a valid configured server URL that corresponds to the plugins route (
/plugins/*
). In these cases we allow a single popup per tab to be opened for certain plugins to do things like OAuth (e.g. GitHub or JIRA).
Any other case will be automatically denied for security reasons.
Links within the same window
By default, the Mattermost Web App marks any link external to its application as
target=_blank
, so that the application doesnâ€™t try to open it in the same window. Any other links should therefore be internal to the application.
We
deny
any sort of in-window navigation with the following exceptions: if the link is a
mailto:
link (which always opens the default mail program), OR if we are in the custom login flow.
Custom login flow
In order to facilitate logging into to the app using an external provider (e.g. Okta) in the same way that one would in the browser, we add an exception to the navigation flow that bypasses the
will-navigate
check.
When a user clicks on a login link that redirects them to a matching URL scheme (listed
here
), we will activate the custom login flow. The URL
MUST
still be internal to the application before we activate this flow, or any URL matching this pattern would allow the app to circumvent the navigation protection.
While the current window is in the custom login flow, all links that emit the
will-navigate
event will be allowed. Anything that opens a new window will still be restricted based on the rules for new windows. We leave the custom login flow once the app has navigated back to an URL internal to the application

The user has provided a detailed text about the Desktop App's navigation control and some configuration parameters for call statistics. \n\nFirst, I should identify the actions mentioned in the text. The actions listed are Collect, Use, and Share. Looking through the text, I see mentions of collecting usage data for functionality and security purposes. So, the action here is \""Collect\"" and \""Use\"".\n\nNext, for data types, the text talks about usage data, which falls under the Usage Data category. There's also mention of IP addresses, which is part of Device Information. Additionally, the configuration includes parameters like applicationVersion, siteID, customerID, etc., which are Contact Data. Also, display names and emails are referenced, so those are part of Contact Data as well.\n\nNow, the purposes. The text states that usage data is used for both Functionality and Security. Additionally, the collection of display names and emails is for Analytics, and the application version and other identifiers are used for Functionality.\n\nFor the stories, I need to create concise statements that tie together actions, data types, and purposes. So, I'll structure them as \""We [action] [data type] for [purpose].\"" This will cover how the app uses data for different purposes.\n\nI should make sure to only use the categories provided and avoid any others.

Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand what it's about. \n\nThe text seems to be about a desktop application, specifically handling navigation and some configuration parameters for call statistics. There are two main sections: one about navigation control in the desktop app and another about callstats configuration.\n\nStarting with the first part about navigation, the app is controlling how users navigate through web content. They mention security and user experience as reasons. They're using Electron and NodeJS APIs, so they're locking down exposed APIs to prevent security breaches. They handle internal navigation through react-router and browserHistory, which sends data to the main process. They clean the path, match it to a view, and display it. For external navigation, they use events like will-navigate and did-start-navigation to control where users go, often opening external links in the default browser.\n\nSo, in terms of actions here, they're Collecting data about navigation and Using it for security and functionality. The data types involved would be Usage Data, specifically App Interactions like pages visited and user engagement.\n\nMoving to the callstats section, it's about configuring parameters for call statistics. They're setting up various IDs, enabling stats collection, and controlling whether to collect IP addresses, display names, and emails. Actions here include Collecting and Using data for analytics and functionality. Data types are Usage Data (like app interactions, session ID, device info), Contact Data (email addresses), and maybe others like server names which could be considered under Usage Data.\n\nPurposes for both sections seem to be Functionality and Security. For callstats, it's also about Analytics.\n\nNow, for the stories, I need to create concise ones. For the navigation part: using usage data for functionality and security. For callstats, using various data types for analytics and functionality.\n\nI have to make sure I only use the allowed categories and subcategories. Let me structure this properly, ensuring each category is correctly tagged and the rationale explains why each choice was made.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Collect, Use</Actions>\n<Data Types>Usage Data:\n  App Interactions:\n    Pages Visited:\n    Session ID:\n  Device Information:\n    IP Address:\nContact Data:\n  Email address:\n</Data Types>\n<Purposes>Functionality, Security, Analytics</Purposes>\n<Stories>1.

Account Basics
==============

* [Home](help)

Registration
---

Not all Friendica sites allow open registration.
If registration is allowed, you will see a ""Register"" link immediately below the login prompt on the site's home page.
Following this link will take you to the site registration page.
The strength of our network is that lots of different sites are all completely compatible with each other.
If the site you're visiting doesn't allow registration, or you think you might prefer another one, there is a [list of public servers here](https://dir.friendica.social/servers) and hopefully you will find one that meets your needs.

If you'd like to have your own server, you can do that too.
Visit [the Friendica website](http://friendi.ca/) to download the code with setup instructions.
It's a very simple installation process that anybody experienced in hosting websites, or with basic Linux experience can handle easily.

### OpenID

The first field on the Registration page is for an OpenID address.
If you do not have an OpenID address or do not wish to use OpenID, leave this field blank.
If you have an OpenID account elsewhere and wish to use it, enter the address into this field and click 'Register'.
Friendica will attempt to extract as much information as possible from your OpenID provider and return to this page with those items already filled in.

### Your Display Name

Please provide your display name **as you would like it to be displayed on this system**.
Some people use their real name for this, but you're under no obligation to do so yourself.

### Email Address

Please provide a valid email address.
Your email address is **never** published.
We need this to send you account information and your login details.
You may also occasionally receive notifications of incoming messages or items requiring your attention, but you have the possibility to completely disable these from your Settings page once you have logged in.
This doesn't have to be your primary email address, but it does need to be a real email address.
You can't get your initial password, or reset a lost password later without it.
This is the only bit of personal information that has to be accurate.

### Nickname

A nickname is used to generate web addresses for many of your personal pages, and is also treated like an email address when establishing communications with others.
Due to the way that the nickname is used, it has some limitations.
It must contain only US-ASCII text characters and numbers, and must also start with a text character.
It also must be unique on this system.
This is used in many places to identify your account, and once set it cannot be changed.


### Directory Publishing

The registration form also allows you to choose whether or not to list your account in the online directory of your node.
This is like a ""phone book"" and you may choose to be unlisted.
We recommend that you select 'Yes' so that other people (friends, family, etc.) will be able to find you.
If you choose 'No', you will essentially be invisible and have few opportunities for interaction.
Whichever you choose, this can be changed any time from your Settings page after you login.

### Register

Once you have provided the necessary details, click the 'Register' button.
An email will be sent to you providing your account login details.
Please check your email (including spam folders) for your registration details and initial password.

Login Page
---

On the 'Login' page, please enter your login information that was provided during registration.
You may use either your nickname or email address as a Login Name.

If you use your account to manage other accounts and these all have the same email address, please enter the nickname for the account you wish to manage.

If your account has been OpenID enabled, you may use your OpenID address as a login name and leave the password blank.
You will be redirected to your OpenID provider to complete your authorisation.

Otherwise, enter your password.
This will have been initially provided in your registration email message.
Your password is case-sensitive, so please check your 'Caps Lock' key if you are having difficulty logging in.

Changing Your Password
---

After your first login, please visit the 'Settings' page from the top menu bar and change your password to something that you will remember.

Getting Started
---

A link with ['Tips for New Members'](newmember) will show up on your network and home pages for two weeks providing key information for getting started.

Retrieving Personal Data
---

You can export a copy of your personal data in JSON format from the ""Export personal data"" link at the top of your settings page.

You need this file to relocate your Friendica account to another node.
This might be necessary, e.g. if your node suffers a severe hardware problem and is not recoverable.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them:

Choosing an Instance
If you are used to sites like Reddit, then Lemmy works in a fundamentally different way. Instead of a single website like reddit.com, there are many different websites (called instances). These are operated by different people, have different topics and rules. Nevertheless, posts created in one instance can directly be seen by users who are registered on another. Its basically like email, but for social media.

This means before using Lemmy and registering an account, you need to pick an instance. For this you can browse the instance list and look for one that matches your topics of interest. You can also see if the rules match your expectations, and how many users there are. It is better to avoid very big or very small instances. But don't worry too much about this choice, you can always create another account on a different instance later.

[instance list screenshot]

Registration
Once you choose an instance, it's time to create your account. To do this, click sign up in the top right of the page, or click the top right button on mobile to open a menu with sign up link.

[registration page screenshot]

On the signup page you need to enter a few things:

Username: How do you want to be called? This name can not be changed and is unique within an instance. Later you can also set a displayname which can be freely changed. If your desired username is taken, consider choosing a different instance where it is still available.
Email: Your email address. This is used for password resets and notifications (if enabled). Providing an email address is usually optional, but admins may choose to make it mandatory. In this case you will have to wait for a confirmation mail and click the link after completing this form.
Password: The password for logging in to your account. Make sure to choose a long and unique password which isn't used on any other website.
Verify password: Repeat the same password from above to ensure that it was entered correctly.
There are also a few optional fields, which you may need to fill in depending on the instance configuration:

Question/Answer: Instance admins can set an arbitrary question which needs to be answered in order to create an account. This is often used to prevent spam bots from signing up. After submitting the form, you will need to wait for some time until the answer is approved manually before you can login.
Code: A captcha which is easy to solve for humans but hard for bots. Enter the letters and numbers that you see in the text box, ignoring uppercase or lowercase. Click the refresh button if you are unable to read a character. The play button plays an audio version of the captcha.
Show NSFW content: Here you can choose if content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only) should be shown.
When you are done, press the sign up button.

It depends on the instance configuration when you can login and start using the account. In case the email is mandatory, you need to wait for the confirmation email and click the link first. In case ""Question/Answer"" is present, you need to wait for an admin to manually review and approve your registration. If you have problems with the registration, try to get in contact with the admin for support. You can also choose a different instance to sign up if your primary choice does not work.

Following Communities
After logging in to your new account, its time to follow communities that you are interested in. For this you can click on the communities link at the top of the page (on mobile, you need to click the menu icon on the top right first). You will see a list of communities which can be filtered by subscribed, local or all. Local communities are those which are hosted on the same site where you are signed in, while all also contains federated communities from other instances. In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.

Another way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the ""sidebar"" button on mobile.

These previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.

Setting up Your Profile
Before you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to ""settings"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:

Displayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time
Bio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown
Matrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat
Avatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts
Banner: A header image for your profile page
On this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:

Blocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.
Interface language: Which language the user interface should use.
Languages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select ""Undetermined"" to see them.
Theme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.
Type: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.
Sort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.
Show NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only).
Show Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.
Show Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.
Bot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically
Show Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.
Show Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.
Show Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.
Send notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.
Start Posting
Finally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.

Other than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as ""not safe for work"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.

One more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right.

In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.\n\nAnother way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the \""sidebar\"" button on mobile.\n\nThese previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.\n\nSetting up Your Profile\nBefore you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to \""settings\"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:\n\nDisplayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time\nBio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown\nMatrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat\nAvatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts\nBanner: A header image for your profile page\nOn this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:\n\nBlocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.\nInterface language: Which language the user interface should use.\nLanguages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select \""Undetermined\"" to see them.\nTheme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.\nType: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.\nSort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.\nShow NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is \""not safe for work\"" (or adult-only).\nShow Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.\nShow Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.\nBot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically\nShow Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.\nShow Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.\nShow Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.\nSend notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.\nStart Posting\nFinally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.\n\nOther than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as \""not safe for work\"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.\n\nOne more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right."", ""metadata"": {""actions"": [""Collect, Use""], ""data_types"": [""Email address, account information""], ""purposes"": [""Account management, Functionality, authenticate""], ""stories"": [""We collect Email Addres and account information  For account management.

First, I need to understand the structure and content of the text. It's about the registration and setup process for a social media platform called Friendica and Lemmy. The user provided a detailed text with sections like Account Basics, Registration, OpenID, Display Name, Email Address, Nickname, Directory Publishing, Login Page, Changing Password, Getting Started, Exporting Personal Data, and so on.\n\nThe task is to annotate this text with Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. I need to use specific categories provided for each. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStarting with Actions, the possible categories are Collect, Use, and Share. From the text, I can see that during registration, the system collects various data like email address, nickname, OpenID, etc. So Collect is definitely an action here. Then, the system uses this data for account management, sending notifications, login details, and functionality. So Use is another action. I don't see any mention of sharing data with third parties, so Share might not be applicable here.\n\nNext, Data Types. The text references email address, account information, nickname, OpenID, display name, and personal data. Looking at the provided categories, email address falls under Contact Data. Account information could include User ID, which is part of Account Information. OpenID is a type of account information as well. Display name and nickname are part of Biographical Data. Personal data is a broader term but fits under the given categories.\n\nFor Purposes, the actions are done for account management, functionality, contact, and security. The system collects data to manage accounts, send notifications (contact), ensure functionality, and secure the account.\n\nStories should tie these together. For example, the system collects email and account info for account management and functionality. It uses email for contact and account info for functionality.\n\nNow, applying this to the entire text. The registration process involves collecting email, nickname, OpenID, etc., for managing accounts and functionality. The system uses this data to send emails, manage logins, and handle account settings. The purpose is to ensure the platform runs smoothly, users can log in, and their data is secure.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only using the categories provided and not adding any new ones. Also, the stories should be concise, showing how actions, data, and purposes interact.\n\nI think I've got a good grasp now. Let's put it all together.\n</think>\n\n```xml\n<Actions>\n    <Action>Collect</Action>\n    <Action>Use</Action>\n</Actions>\n\n<DataTypes>\n    <DataType>Contact Data</DataType>\n    <DataType>Account Information</DataType>\n    <DataType>Biographical Data</DataType>\n</DataTypes>\n\n<Purposes>\n    <Purpose>Account Management</Purpose>\n    <Purpose>Functionality</Purpose>\n    <Purpose>Contact</Purpose>\n</Purposes>\n\n<Stories>\n    <Story>We collect email address and account information for account management. We use email address and account information for functionality. We use email address and account information for contact.</Story>\n</Stories>\n\n<R>\nThe annotations are based on the text's discussion of user registration and account setup. The system collects email addresses and account information during registration, which are used for managing accounts, enabling functionality, and contacting users. The stories reflect these interactions, emphasizing data collection and usage for essential purposes.\n</R>\n```""","""<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user by annotating the given text with privacy-related metadata. The user has provided a detailed text about the registration and setup process for a social media platform, along with some usage instructions. My task is to extract specific actions, data types, purposes, and create stories based on these.\n\nFirst, I'll go through the text to identify the actions. The text mentions collecting email addresses, usernames, passwords, etc. So the actions here are Collect and Use. There's no mention of sharing data, so I'll stick with those two.\n\nNext, the data types. The text refers to email addresses, usernames, passwords, and other account information. These fall under Contact Data and Account Information. I need to make sure I list all the specific subcategories mentioned, like Email address and Username under Contact Data, and Password and Account Balance under Account Information.\n\nFor purposes, the text is mainly about managing accounts and functionality. The email is used for sending login details and notifications, which is for account management and functionality. The username and password are for account creation and security, so those purposes fit as well.\n\nNow, creating the stories. The stories should succinctly describe how the actions, data types, and purposes interact. I'll frame them as \""We [action] [data type] for [purpose].\"" So, collecting email and account info for account management and functionality, using them for contact and functionality as well.\n\nI should also explain why I chose these annotations. The text clearly talks about collecting data during registration for managing accounts and functional purposes. Using the data for login and notifications makes sense, which ties back to the purposes I identified.\n\nI need to make sure my annotations are accurate and cover all relevant parts of the text without adding anything extra. Also, I should present this in the specified XML format without using any markdown, keeping it clean and structured as per the user's instructions.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Collect, Use</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \n  Contact Data:  \n    Email address:  \n    Username:  \n  Account Information:  \n    Password:  \n    Account Balance:  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>Account Management, Functionality</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n1.

The data types include \""Email address\"" and \""Username\"" under Contact Data, as well as \""Password\"" and \""Account Balance\"" under Account Information. The purposes are \""Account Management\"" and \""Functionality,\"" as the data is used to create and manage user accounts, send notifications, and enable platform features. The stories summarize how the platform interacts with user data for these purposes.  \n</R>"""

Getting Started
Choosing an Instance
If you are used to sites like Reddit, then Lemmy works in a fundamentally different way. Instead of a single website like reddit.com, there are many different websites (called instances). These are operated by different people, have different topics and rules. Nevertheless, posts created in one instance can directly be seen by users who are registered on another. Its basically like email, but for social media.

This means before using Lemmy and registering an account, you need to pick an instance. For this you can browse the instance list and look for one that matches your topics of interest. You can also see if the rules match your expectations, and how many users there are. It is better to avoid very big or very small instances. But don't worry too much about this choice, you can always create another account on a different instance later.

[instance list screenshot]

Registration
Once you choose an instance, it's time to create your account. To do this, click sign up in the top right of the page, or click the top right button on mobile to open a menu with sign up link.

[registration page screenshot]

On the signup page you need to enter a few things:

Username: How do you want to be called? This name can not be changed and is unique within an instance. Later you can also set a displayname which can be freely changed. If your desired username is taken, consider choosing a different instance where it is still available.
Email: Your email address. This is used for password resets and notifications (if enabled). Providing an email address is usually optional, but admins may choose to make it mandatory. In this case you will have to wait for a confirmation mail and click the link after completing this form.
Password: The password for logging in to your account. Make sure to choose a long and unique password which isn't used on any other website.
Verify password: Repeat the same password from above to ensure that it was entered correctly.
There are also a few optional fields, which you may need to fill in depending on the instance configuration:

Question/Answer: Instance admins can set an arbitrary question which needs to be answered in order to create an account. This is often used to prevent spam bots from signing up. After submitting the form, you will need to wait for some time until the answer is approved manually before you can login.
Code: A captcha which is easy to solve for humans but hard for bots. Enter the letters and numbers that you see in the text box, ignoring uppercase or lowercase. Click the refresh button if you are unable to read a character. The play button plays an audio version of the captcha.
Show NSFW content: Here you can choose if content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only) should be shown.
When you are done, press the sign up button.

It depends on the instance configuration when you can login and start using the account. In case the email is mandatory, you need to wait for the confirmation email and click the link first. In case ""Question/Answer"" is present, you need to wait for an admin to manually review and approve your registration. If you have problems with the registration, try to get in contact with the admin for support. You can also choose a different instance to sign up if your primary choice does not work.

Following Communities
After logging in to your new account, its time to follow communities that you are interested in. For this you can click on the communities link at the top of the page (on mobile, you need to click the menu icon on the top right first). You will see a list of communities which can be filtered by subscribed, local or all. Local communities are those which are hosted on the same site where you are signed in, while all also contains federated communities from other instances. In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.

Another way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the ""sidebar"" button on mobile.

These previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.

Setting up Your Profile
Before you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to ""settings"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:

Displayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time
Bio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown
Matrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat
Avatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts
Banner: A header image for your profile page
On this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:

Blocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.
Interface language: Which language the user interface should use.
Languages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select ""Undetermined"" to see them.
Theme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.
Type: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.
Sort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.
Show NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only).
Show Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.
Show Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.
Bot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically
Show Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.
Show Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.
Show Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.
Send notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.
Start Posting
Finally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.

Other than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as ""not safe for work"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.

One more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them:

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text to understand the context. It seems to be a guide on using a platform similar to Reddit, explaining how to choose an instance, register, follow communities, set up a profile, and start posting. There's also a part about managing profiles and preferences, including things like passwords, avatars, themes, and notifications.\n\nNow, looking at the Actions category, I remember the options are Collect, Use, and Share. I'll scan the text for these actions. For instance, during registration, the user provides a username, email, password, and might fill in optional fields like a question/answer or a CAPTCHA. This is a clear case of data collection, so Collect is an action here.\n\nNext, when the user logs in, the system uses the email and password for authentication, which falls under the Use action. Also, when setting up a profile, the user can provide more information like display name, bio, avatar, etc., which is another Collect action. The system then uses this data to manage the account and provide functionality, so Use applies again.\n\nLooking at Data Types, I see several subcategories. The username, email, and password are part of Account Information. The display name, bio, avatar, and other profile details also fall under Account Information. Additionally, when setting preferences like notifications, continuous playback, and themes, these are part of Usage Data, specifically User Engagement.\n\nFor Purposes, the data is used for Account Management, such as creating and managing the user's account. It's also used for Authentication when logging in. Providing a personalized experience through themes and preferences falls under Customization. Ensuring security, like strong passwords and CAPTCHA, is part of Security.\n\nNow, constructing the stories. The first story is about collecting email and account info for account management and using it for authentication and functionality. The second story involves collecting profile and preference data for customization and security.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only using the specified categories and subcategories. For example, under Data Types, I used Account Information and Usage Data. Under Purposes, I used Account Management, Authentication, Functionality, Customization, and Security.\n\nI should double-check if there are any other actions, data types, or purposes I missed. The text doesn't mention sharing data, so Share isn't applicable here. It's mostly about collecting and using data.\n\nI think that's it. Now, I'll structure the annotations as per the instructions, ensuring each category is properly tagged and the rationale is clear.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \n  Collect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n\n<Data Types>  \n  Account Information:  \n    Username:  \n    Password:  \n    Email address:  \n    Displayname:  \n    Bio:  \n    Avatar:  \n    Banner:  \n  Usage Data:  \n    User Engagement:  \n      Preferences:  \n</Data Types>  \n\n<Purposes>  \n  Account Management, Authentication, Functionality, Customization, Security  \n</Purposes>  \n\n<Stories>  \n1.

The data types include account information like username, password, and email, as well as profile details like display name, bio, avatar, and preferences. These are used for purposes such as account management, authentication, and customization. The stories capture how the platform collects and uses data to create and manage user accounts, provide functionality, and offer a personalized experience.  \n</R>""","""<think>\nOkay, I need to help the user by annotating the given text with privacy-related metadata. The user has provided a detailed text about using a platform similar to Reddit, focusing on registration, account setup, and profile management. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the text to identify the key actions, data types, purposes, and stories. \n\nStarting with actions: The text mentions collecting email addresses and passwords during registration, which falls under 'Collect'. Then, these are used for authentication and functionality, so 'Use' is also relevant.\n\nFor data types, the main ones are Email address and Account information. The email is used for password resets and notifications, while account info includes username and password.\n\nPurposes include Account Management, Authentication, and Functionality. The platform manages accounts, authenticates users, and uses data to enable features.\n\nStories should tie these together.

Edit on GitHub
Navigation
The Desktop App exercises relatively strict control over the userâ€™s ability to navigate through the web. This is done for a few reasons:
Security:
Since we expose certain Electron (and therefore NodeJS) APIs to the front-end application, we want to be in control of what scripts are run in the front-end. We make a concerted effort to lock down the exposed APIs to only what is necessary; however, to avoid any privacy or security breaches, itâ€™s best to avoid allowing the user to navigate to any page that isnâ€™t explicitly trusted.
User Experience:
Our application is ONLY designed to work with the Mattermost Web App and thus allowing the user to navigate to other places that are not the Web App is not a supported use case, and could create some undesirable effects.
Internal navigation
The Mattermost Web App is self-contained, with the majority of links provided by
react-router
and thus most navigation is handled by that module. However, in the Desktop App, we have a major feature that allows users to navigate between distinct tabs bound to the same server. There are two ways that this style of navigation happens in the Web App:
A user clicks on a link provided by the
react-router
Link
component
The application calls
browserHistory.push
directly within the Web App based on the user action
Both of these methods will make use of the
browserHistory
module within the Web App.
When one of the above methods is used, normally the Web App would update the browserâ€™s URL and change the state of the page. In the Desktop App, we instead send the arguments of the call to
browserHistory.push
up to the Electron Main Process. The information is received at the method
WindowManager.handleBrowserHistoryPush
, where we perform the following actions:
Clean the path name by removing any part of the serverâ€™s subpath pathname.
When the arguments are sent up to the Desktop App, it includes the subpath of the server hosting it.
As an example, if the server URL is
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, any path that is received will start with
/mattermost
and we will need to remove that component. The same would be true for any other path following the origin
http://server-1.com
.
Retrieve the view matching the path name
After removing the leading subpath (if applicable), we check to see if a portion of the path matches one of the other tabs, signally that we will need to switch to that tab.
For server
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, if the pathname is
/mattermost/boards/board1
, we would get the
Boards
view matching the server.
Display the correct view and send the cleaned path to its renderer process
We then explicitly display the new view if itâ€™s not currently in focus. If itâ€™s closed, we open it and load the corresponding URL with the provided path.
Exception
: If weâ€™re redirecting to the root of the application and the user is not logged in, it will generate an unnecessary refresh. In this case, we do not send the path name down.
External navigation
For the cases where a user wants to navigate away from the Web App to an external site, we generally want to direct the user outside of the Desktop App and have them open their default web browser and use the external site in that application.
In order to achieve this, we need to explicitly handle every other link and method of navigation that is available to an Electron renderer process. Fortunately, Electron provides a few listeners that help us with that:
will-navigate
is an event that fires when the URL is changed for a given renderer process. Attaching a listener for this event allows us to prevent the navigation if desired.
NOTE: The event will not fire for in-page navigations or updating
window.location.hash
.
did-start-navigation
is another renderer process event that will fire once the page has started navigating. We can use this event to perform any actions when a certain URL is visited.
new-window
is an event that will fire when the user tries to open a new window or tab. This commonly will fire when the user clicks on a link marked
target=_blank
. We attach this listener using the
setWindowOpenHandler
and will allow us to
allow
or
deny
the opening as we desire.
In our application, we define all of these listeners in the
webContentEvents
module, and we attach them whenever a new
webContents
object is create to make sure that all renderer processes are correctly secured and set up correctly.
New window handling
Our new window handler will
deny
the opening of a new Electron window if any of the following cases are true:
Malformed URL:
Depending on the case, it will outright ignore it (if the URL could not be parsed), or it will open the userâ€™s default browser if it is somehow invalid in another way.
Untrusted Protocol:
If the URL does not match an allowed protocol (allowed protocols include
http
,
https
, and any other protocol that was explicitly allowed by the user).
In this case, it will ask the user whether the protocol should be allowed, and if so will open the URL in the userâ€™s default application that corresponds to that protocol.
Unknown Site:
If the URL does not match the root of a configured server, it will always try to open the link in the userâ€™s default browser.
If the URL DOES match the root of a configured server, we still will deny the window opening for a few cases:
If the URL matches the public files route (
/api/v4/public/files/*
)
If the URL matches the image proxy route (
/api/v4/image/*
)
If the URL matches the help route (
/help/*
)
For these cases, we will open the link in the userâ€™s browser.
Deep Link Case
: If the URL doesnâ€™t match any of the above routes, but is still a valid configured server, we will generally treat is as the deep link cause, and will instead attempt to show the correct tab as well as navigate to the corresponding URL within the app.
There are two cases where we do allow the application to open a new window:
If the URL matches the
devtools:
protocol, so that we can open the Chrome Developer Tools.
If the URL is a valid configured server URL that corresponds to the plugins route (
/plugins/*
). In these cases we allow a single popup per tab to be opened for certain plugins to do things like OAuth (e.g. GitHub or JIRA).
Any other case will be automatically denied for security reasons.
Links within the same window
By default, the Mattermost Web App marks any link external to its application as
target=_blank
, so that the application doesnâ€™t try to open it in the same window. Any other links should therefore be internal to the application.
We
deny
any sort of in-window navigation with the following exceptions: if the link is a
mailto:
link (which always opens the default mail program), OR if we are in the custom login flow.
Custom login flow
In order to facilitate logging into to the app using an external provider (e.g. Okta) in the same way that one would in the browser, we add an exception to the navigation flow that bypasses the
will-navigate
check.
When a user clicks on a login link that redirects them to a matching URL scheme (listed
here
), we will activate the custom login flow. The URL
MUST
still be internal to the application before we activate this flow, or any URL matching this pattern would allow the app to circumvent the navigation protection.
While the current window is in the custom login flow, all links that emit the
will-navigate
event will be allowed. Anything that opens a new window will still be restricted based on the rules for new windows. We leave the custom login flow once the app has navigated back to an URL internal to the application

Direct Messaging with LibreEHR and EMR Direct phiMail(R)
Version 1.3, 19 Jul 2014

A. Purpose: To provide a secure method from within LibreEHR for sending/receiving 
protected health information to/from another Direct address using the Direct Project 
messaging standard, as a step toward the goal of satisfying the three MU2 criteria 
requiring the use of Direct messaging.  (For general information about Direct messaging, 
see http://www.emrdirect.com/about-directed-exchange-and-secure-direct-messaging.html)

B. IMPORTANT:  Please be aware of the following limitations when using the LibreEHR 
Direct Messaging features with PHI in a production environment:

1. the current code only supports a single shared ""group"" Direct Address for each LibreEHR 
installation. Note that this model is fully compliant with the Direct Project 
requirements for Direct messaging, but we may add additional models in the future 
should we determine that doing so would provide a higher degree of interoperability for 
LibreEHR users.

2. the current code only sends the CCR or CCD XML data that is already available in LibreEHR; 
these files as currently generated by existing LibreEHR code do not meet the requirements 
of the MU2 criteria, and the current CCD files do not pass strict CDA validation tests.

C. Problems Solved:

1. Patient-initiated transmission of clinical data from the Report section of the Patient 
Portal interface.

2. Provider-initiated transmission of clinical data from the Report section of the Patient 
pane in the main LibreEHR interface.

3. Log all data transmissions including date/time, patient, and whether transmission 
was initiated by the patient through the Patient Portal or by an LibreEHR user through the 
main interface.

4. Receive Direct messages from other sources.

D. How it Works:
Once configured, LibreEHR will interface with a phiMail Direct messaging server to complete the
required message transactions. The phiMail platform is described on the EMR Direct website, 
http://www.emrdirect.com and http://www.emrdirect.com/phimail-faq.html.

E. What you need before enabling Direct Messaging in LibreEHR:

1. Test Mode: Developers may request a complimentary test address at 
https://www.emrdirect.com/subscribe-developer  
Access to a sandbox server is available for testing and development purposes.

2. Production Mode: Healthcare provider users should begin by signing up for a production 
Direct messaging account with EMR Direct by registering at https://www.emrdirect.com/subscribe

Subscribers will receive the username, password, and server address information with which to 
configure LibreEHR.  

F. How to enable the Direct Messaging Features in LibreEHR:
Setup of phiMail Direct messaging Service is done in the Administration::Globals::Connectors 
tab

1. Check the ""Enable phiMail Direct Messaging Service"" checkbox.

2. Enter the Server Address, Username, and Password provided to you. The server address
will be of the form ""ssl://servername.example.com:32541"" - replace the hostname and port
with the values provided to you by EMR Direct. The Username is your Direct Address. Do not 
enter the server URL into your browser address bar, as this will not work.

3. Specify the LibreEHR user who will receive notification of new incoming Direct messages. 
Enter their LibreEHR username in the notification user field.

4. Specify the interval for automatic message checking; we suggest 5 or 10 minutes as a
starting point, but installations processing a large number of Direct messages may want a 
shorter interval. To disable automatic message checking through LibreEHR's background service
manager, set the interval to 0 (zero). Disabling automatic checking would be appropriate 
if message checking is managed through another mechanism, such as a system cron job.

5. Optionally check ""phiMail Allow CCD Send"" and/or ""phiMail Allow CCR Send"" to enable
the Transmit feature for these data types. If you do not select at least one of these,
LibreEHR will operate in a receive-only mode.

6. Click the ""Save"" button.

7. Confirm that a valid Notification Email Address is set in the Administration::
Globals::Notifications tab to receive error notifications from the Direct Messaging service.

8. Install the EMR Direct trust anchor certificate.  

Note: This is *not* your Direct certificate; it is the trust anchor for the SSL 
certificate issued to our servers, and is used only to validate the SSL certificate 
presented by the phiMail server on the other side of LibreEHR's connection.  Your Direct private
key and certificate are managed by the phiMail Server and are not installed in LibreEHR.
Your Direct certificate is made availabe for your review by EMR Direct, but you will not
need to install it anywhere.

For added security, the trust anchor for the phiMail Server should be installed in the LibreEHR 
installation tree at:

[installation_root]/sites/[site_id]/documents/phimail_server_pem/phimail_server.pem

This phimail_server_pem directory and its contents should be readable by the the 
webserver process, but only writable by trusted local users. The certificate file 
itself must be PEM encoded. You can identify a PEM encoded certificate file because 
it begins with the text ""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"". Although LibreEHR will connect 
to phiMail servers without installing this certificate, this is a required configuration 
step for all production  accounts to ensure that you are connecting to the correct 
server. You can obtain the correct certificate at the following URLs:

  a. Test accounts: http://certs.emrdirect.com/EMRDirectTestCA.crt
     Important: Don't forget to rename the file to phimail_server.pem and install it
     in the correct directory.

  b. Production accounts: https://www.phicert.com/certs/phiCertDirectRootCA.crt
     Important: The production root must be converted to PEM format as follows:
     $ openssl x509 -in phiCertDirectRootCA.crt -inform DER -out phimail_server.pem
     Don't forget to install phimail_server.pem in the correct directory. As an added
     security measure, please call us to confirm the thumbprint on this certificate.

G. Debugging background connections to the server.

You may review the connection activity to the server by Selecting Administration::Other::Logs,
selecting ""direct-message"" in the ""Name of events:"" drop-down menu, and clicking ""[Refresh]"".
If the background service is succesfully connecting, you will see ""message check completed""
events in the log as well as any message related entries (see below for instructions to
view more detailed message related status information). If you see no entries, make sure that
the background service is enabled (See F.4 above). If you see ""could not connect to server""
entries, each entry will also contain an error code:

  C1: phiMail is disabled in the global configuration. Fix: enable.
  C2: the phiMail server URL entered in the global configuration is invalid. Fix: Confirm
      the URL has been entered correctly. It should be of the form 
      ""ssl://server.example.com:32541"".
  C3: unable to create stream context. Fix: Usually this is because the server certificate 
      file installed in F.8 above is not the correct certificate or is in the wrong format.
  C4: failed to open connection. Fix: Confirm you Internet service and local DNS servers are
      online and your firewall is not blocking connections to the phiMail Server.

H. Checking the status and history of the Direct Messaging Service in LibreEHR:
Administrators may view the status of the service by Selecting Reports::Services::Background 
Services from the main LibreEHR left navigation bar. The ""View Log"" link on this page or 
Reports::Services::Direct Message Log will open the messaging history log showing each message 
sent or received and the current status of that message (Received, Sent, Delivery Confirmed, 
or Failed).

I. Note of message status messages: Receiving message status updates requires that Direct message
checking be enabled. When receiving messages, the phiMail back-end is fully compliant with the 
Direct messaging protocols to notify the sender and provide final delivery confirmation, but 
please note that  many other Direct providers do not yet support these features. If a message 
is sent to a recipient using one of these other systems, LibreEHR probably won't ever receive a 
final delivery confirmation for that message.

J. How to use the Direct Messaging Features in LibreEHR:

1. Sending:
When the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, an additional ""Transmit"" button will
appear in the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) and/or Continuity of Care Document (CCD) block 
of the Reports section in both the Patient Portal and the Patient pane of the main provider 
interface. 

To transmit a CCR or CCD, first click the ""Transmit"" button. This will open a small dialog 
immediately below the button with a form field to enter the intended recipient's Direct Address. 
Clicking ""Transmit"" again will hide the dialog.

A Direct Address should have the same form as a regular email address, e.g. 
jonesclinic@direct.example.com. Enter the address in the field and click the ""Send"" button 
immediately to the right of the field. Only a single recipient may be specified in the field.
The Send button will be temporarily disabled while LibreEHR is communicating with the phiMail 
server. This will only work for properly-configured Direct addresses. Attempts to send to a 
regular email address or Direct address outside of our test mode ""trust sandbox"" will fail
during testing. Production accounts have wide interoperability with other Direct service
providers. Should you encounter a trust community with which LibreEHR does not interoperate,
please let us know at support@emrdirect.com.

LibreEHR will then display a status message immediately below the Address field, the 
success or failure of the message transmission, or an error message. If the message is
successfully submitted to the server, the Address field will be cleared to prevent accidental
re-transmission. If multiple recipients are required, the next recipient can now be entered.

If you receive an error message, it will be followed by an error code. For a discussion
of error codes beginning with the letter ""C"" please see section G above. Error codes
beginning with ""EC"" are listed here:

  EC 1: phiMail disabled in global configuration. Fix: enable.
  EC 4: authentication failure. Fix: The Username and Password entered in the
        global configuration must be corrected.
  EC 5: request to add text failed. Fix: Confirm total message length < 5MB.
  EC 6: problem sending the text. Fix: Confirm your local network connectivity is stable.
  EC 7: request to add clinical document failed. Fix: see EC 5.
  EC 8: problem sending the clinical document. Fix: see EC 6.

2. Receiving:
When the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, and message checking is enabled either 
through the background services manager of another mechanism, LibreEHR will automatically process 
message status updates and new messages. Status updates will be reflected immediately in the 
Direct Messaging log. Additionally, if a ""Failed"" notification is received for a previously sent 
message, a regular email message will be generated to the Notification Email Address specified 
in the Notifications tab of the Global Settings panel (accessed by selecting Administration::
Globals from the main left navigation menu).

New Direct messages will be processed as follows. A new ""Patient Note"" will be generated and 
sent to the phiMail notification user specified in the Connectors tab of the Global settings. 
The patient note will contain information about the message, including any text at the beginning 
of the message from the sender. Any attachments (and any non-text content) will be automatically 
converted to separate LibreEHR Documents, which will be referenced in the new Patient Note.  
The Documents and the Patient Note are initially created without an assigned patient. 

At this time, the envisioned workflow is that the notification user will review the message text
and any included Documents to determine which patient the content belongs to and will then set the 
patient using the existing Patient Note interface for choosing a patient. Once the patient is sent, 
the Patient Note can be forwarded to another provider or staff member as appropriate using the 
existing forwarding mechanism for Patient Notes. The unassigned Documents can be viewed by Selecting 
Miscellaneous::New Documents from the main left navigation menu, which opens a Documents list. Once 
the specified document is opened, the user can optionally categorize the document and, when 
appropriate, assign the document to a specific patient using the ""Move to Patient #"" feature in the 
Documents interface.

The \""View Log\"" link on this page or \nReports::Services::Direct Message Log will open the messaging history log showing each message \nsent or received and the current status of that message (Received, Sent, Delivery Confirmed, \nor Failed).\n\nI. Note of message status messages: Receiving message status updates requires that Direct message\nchecking be enabled. When receiving messages, the phiMail back-end is fully compliant with the \nDirect messaging protocols to notify the sender and provide final delivery confirmation, but \nplease note that  many other Direct providers do not yet support these features. If a message \nis sent to a recipient using one of these other systems, LibreEHR probably won't ever receive a \nfinal delivery confirmation for that message.\n\nJ. How to use the Direct Messaging Features in LibreEHR:\n\n1. Sending:\nWhen the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, an additional \""Transmit\"" button will\nappear in the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) and/or Continuity of Care Document (CCD) block \nof the Reports section in both the Patient Portal and the Patient pane of the main provider \ninterface. \n\nTo transmit a CCR or CCD, first click the \""Transmit\"" button. This will open a small dialog \nimmediately below the button with a form field to enter the intended recipient's Direct Address. \nClicking \""Transmit\"" again will hide the dialog.\n\nA Direct Address should have the same form as a regular email address, e.g. \njonesclinic@direct.example.com. Enter the address in the field and click the \""Send\"" button \nimmediately to the right of the field. Only a single recipient may be specified in the field.\nThe Send button will be temporarily disabled while LibreEHR is communicating with the phiMail \nserver. This will only work for properly-configured Direct addresses. Attempts to send to a \nregular email address or Direct address outside of our test mode \""trust sandbox\"" will fail\nduring testing. Production accounts have wide interoperability with other Direct service\nproviders. Should you encounter a trust community with which LibreEHR does not interoperate,\nplease let us know at support@emrdirect.com.\n\nLibreEHR will then display a status message immediately below the Address field, the \nsuccess or failure of the message transmission, or an error message. If the message is\nsuccessfully submitted to the server, the Address field will be cleared to prevent accidental\nre-transmission. If multiple recipients are required, the next recipient can now be entered.\n\nIf you receive an error message, it will be followed by an error code. For a discussion\nof error codes beginning with the letter \""C\"" please see section G above. Error codes\nbeginning with \""EC\"" are listed here:\n\n  EC 1: phiMail disabled in global configuration. Fix: enable.\n  EC 4: authentication failure. Fix: The Username and Password entered in the\n        global configuration must be corrected.\n  EC 5: request to add text failed. Fix: Confirm total message length < 5MB.\n  EC 6: problem sending the text. Fix: Confirm your local network connectivity is stable.\n  EC 7: request to add clinical document failed. Fix: see EC 5.\n  EC 8: problem sending the clinical document. Fix: see EC 6.\n\n2. Receiving:\nWhen the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, and message checking is enabled either \nthrough the background services manager of another mechanism, LibreEHR will automatically process \nmessage status updates and new messages. Status updates will be reflected immediately in the \nDirect Messaging log. Additionally, if a \""Failed\"" notification is received for a previously sent \nmessage, a regular email message will be generated to the Notification Email Address specified \nin the Notifications tab of the Global Settings panel (accessed by selecting Administration::\nGlobals from the main left navigation menu).\n\nNew Direct messages will be processed as follows. A new \""Patient Note\"" will be generated and \nsent to the phiMail notification user specified in the Connectors tab of the Global settings. \nThe patient note will contain information about the message, including any text at the beginning \nof the message from the sender. Any attachments (and any non-text content) will be automatically \nconverted to separate LibreEHR Documents, which will be referenced in the new Patient Note.  \nThe Documents and the Patient Note are initially created without an assigned patient. \n\nAt this time, the envisioned workflow is that the notification user will review the message text\nand any included Documents to determine which patient the content belongs to and will then set the \npatient using the existing Patient Note interface for choosing a patient. Once the patient is sent, \nthe Patient Note can be forwarded to another provider or staff member as appropriate using the \nexisting forwarding mechanism for Patient Notes. The unassigned Documents can be viewed by Selecting \nMiscellaneous::New Documents from the main left navigation menu, which opens a Documents list. Once \nthe specified document is opened, the user can optionally categorize the document and, when \nappropriate, assign the document to a specific patient using the \""Move to Patient #\"" feature in the \nDocuments interface.\n\n\nTrademark Notice: phiMail is a registered trademark of EMR Direct.\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 EMR Direct."", ""metadata"": {""actions"": [""Share, Collect, Use""], ""data_types"": [""Health data, address, usage data""], ""purposes"": [""requirements, Functionality, security""], ""stories"": [""We share health data and address for requirements.

So, the user has given me a text about LibreEHR and EMR Direct's phiMail Direct Messaging, and they want me to annotate it with specific metadata. The categories to use are Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. They also want me to explain my rationale for each annotation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure. The text is quite technical, detailing how the Direct Messaging feature works within LibreEHR, including setup, configuration, sending, and receiving messages. It's focused on secure messaging for healthcare data.\n\nStarting with Actions: The text talks about sending and receiving messages, which implies the 'Share' action. Also, the system logs data transmissions, which is a 'Collect' action. There's no mention of using the data for other purposes beyond functionality and security, so I won't include 'Use' here.\n\nFor Data Types, the main data involved is Health Data, specifically protected health information (PHI) like CCR and CCD documents. There's also mention of transmission logs, which would fall under Usage Data, as it's about tracking user interactions and system events.\n\nPurposes: The primary purposes are Functionality, to enable messaging, and Security, to protect health data. There's also a mention of logging for tracking, which relates to Security as well as Functionality.\n\nStories: The stories should tie together the actions, data, and purposes. So, we share health data for functionality and security, collect usage data for the same reasons, and handle health data securely.\n\nNow, the rationale. The actions 'Share' and 'Collect' are clear from the text. 'Share' is about sending and receiving messages, while 'Collect' is about logging. Health Data is explicitly mentioned as CCR and CCD. Usage Data comes from the logs and message tracking. The purposes are Functionality to make the messaging work and Security to protect PHI. The stories connect these elements to show how data is handled to meet both functional and security needs.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the correct categories and not adding any extra ones. Also, the stories should be concise and directly tie the elements together without extra fluff. \n\nWait, in the example provided by the user, they had multiple stories. Should I include more than one? Let me check. The user's example had two stories, so maybe I can split it into two as well. One about sharing for functionality and security, and another about collecting logs for the same purposes.\n\nAlso, I should ensure that I'm not missing any data types. The text mentions Direct Addresses, which are like email addresses, so that's part of Contact Data. But since the focus is on PHI, Health Data is more prominent.\n\nI think that's about it. I need to structure the annotations clearly, using the specified tags, and then explain each part in the rationale.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>\nCollect, Share\n</Actions>\n\n<Data Types>\nHealth Data:\n  Clinical documents:\n    CCR:\n    CCD:\nContact Data:\n  Direct Address:\nUsage Data:\n  Logs:\n    Transmission logs:\n    Message status updates:\n</Data Types>\n\n<Purposes>\nFunctionality, Security\n</Purposes>\n\n<Stories>\nWe share health data for Functionality. We share health data for Security. We collect usage data for Functionality. We collect usage data for Security.\n</Stories>\n\n<R>\nActions: The text describes the sharing of clinical documents (CCR and CCD) via Direct Messaging, which falls under the \""Share\"" action. Additionally, the system collects logs and message status updates, which falls under the \""Collect\"" action.\n\nData Types: The primary data type referenced is Health Data, specifically clinical documents (CCR and CCD). Contact Data is also referenced in the form of Direct Addresses. Usage Data is mentioned in the context of logs and message status updates.\n\nPurposes: The main purposes are Functionality, as the system enables secure messaging for healthcare data exchange, and Security, as it ensures protected health information (PHI) is handled securely and in compliance with standards like Direct Project requirements.\n\nStories: The stories capture how the system shares health data for both functionality and security purposes, and how it collects usage data to ensure the system operates correctly and securely.\n</R>""","""<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this text about LibreEHR and their Direct Messaging feature with phiMail. The user wants me to annotate this text with specific metadata categories: Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. They provided some examples and a structure to follow, so I need to make sure I stick to those guidelines.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reading through the text carefully to understand what it's about. It seems like it's a user guide or documentation for setting up and using Direct Messaging in LibreEHR, which is a healthcare application. The feature allows sending and receiving protected health information (PHI) using the Direct Project messaging standard.\n\nNow, I need to identify the actions mentioned. The text talks about sending and receiving messages, so \""Share\"" and \""Use\"" come to mind. When they send a message, that's sharing data, and when they receive, it's using the data.\n\nNext, the data types. The text mentions PHI, which includes CCR and CCD documents. These are specific types of health data, so under Health Data, I should categorize them as such. There's also mention of transmission logs, which include data like date/time, patient info, and whether it's initiated by a patient or provider. That seems like it could fall under Usage Data or maybe Biographical Data, but since it's more about the interaction, maybe Usage Data makes more sense.\n\nFor purposes, the primary goal is functionality—making sure the messaging works correctly. There's also a security aspect, as they're handling PHI and need to ensure it's protected. So the purposes would be Functionality and Security.\n\nNow, the stories. The examples given in the text are about transmitting PHI and receiving messages. So I can create concise stories like \""We share health data for functionality and security. We use health data for functionality and security.\""\n\nLooking back, I should make sure I'm only using the categories provided. Actions are Collect, Use, Share. I identified Share and Use. Data Types include Health Data, which I used. Purposes include Functionality and Security. \n\nI think I covered everything. Now, I'll structure the annotations as per the user's instructions, separating each category and providing a rationale for each.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \n  Share, Use  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \n  Health Data:  \n    CCR, CCD  \n  Usage Data:  \n    Transmission logs  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \n  Functionality, Security  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n  We share health data for Functionality. We use health data for Security.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \nThe text describes the functionality and security measures of the LibreEHR Direct Messaging feature, which allows users to send and receive protected health information (PHI) using the Direct Project standard. The actions identified are \""Share\"" (for sending PHI) and \""Use\"" (for receiving and processing PHI). The data types include health data (specifically CCR and CCD documents) and usage data (such as transmission logs). The purposes are Functionality (enabling the messaging feature) and Security (protecting PHI and ensuring secure transmission). The stories capture the essence of sharing and using health data for these purposes.  \n</R>"""

Direct Messaging with LibreEHR and EMR Direct phiMail(R)
Version 1.3, 19 Jul 2014

A. Purpose: To provide a secure method from within LibreEHR for sending/receiving 
protected health information to/from another Direct address using the Direct Project 
messaging standard, as a step toward the goal of satisfying the three MU2 criteria 
requiring the use of Direct messaging.  (For general information about Direct messaging, 
see http://www.emrdirect.com/about-directed-exchange-and-secure-direct-messaging.html)

B. IMPORTANT:  Please be aware of the following limitations when using the LibreEHR 
Direct Messaging features with PHI in a production environment:

1. the current code only supports a single shared ""group"" Direct Address for each LibreEHR 
installation. Note that this model is fully compliant with the Direct Project 
requirements for Direct messaging, but we may add additional models in the future 
should we determine that doing so would provide a higher degree of interoperability for 
LibreEHR users.

2. the current code only sends the CCR or CCD XML data that is already available in LibreEHR; 
these files as currently generated by existing LibreEHR code do not meet the requirements 
of the MU2 criteria, and the current CCD files do not pass strict CDA validation tests.

C. Problems Solved:

1. Patient-initiated transmission of clinical data from the Report section of the Patient 
Portal interface.

2. Provider-initiated transmission of clinical data from the Report section of the Patient 
pane in the main LibreEHR interface.

3. Log all data transmissions including date/time, patient, and whether transmission 
was initiated by the patient through the Patient Portal or by an LibreEHR user through the 
main interface.

4. Receive Direct messages from other sources.

D. How it Works:
Once configured, LibreEHR will interface with a phiMail Direct messaging server to complete the
required message transactions. The phiMail platform is described on the EMR Direct website, 
http://www.emrdirect.com and http://www.emrdirect.com/phimail-faq.html.

E. What you need before enabling Direct Messaging in LibreEHR:

1. Test Mode: Developers may request a complimentary test address at 
https://www.emrdirect.com/subscribe-developer  
Access to a sandbox server is available for testing and development purposes.

2. Production Mode: Healthcare provider users should begin by signing up for a production 
Direct messaging account with EMR Direct by registering at https://www.emrdirect.com/subscribe

Subscribers will receive the username, password, and server address information with which to 
configure LibreEHR.  

F. How to enable the Direct Messaging Features in LibreEHR:
Setup of phiMail Direct messaging Service is done in the Administration::Globals::Connectors 
tab

1. Check the ""Enable phiMail Direct Messaging Service"" checkbox.

2. Enter the Server Address, Username, and Password provided to you. The server address
will be of the form ""ssl://servername.example.com:32541"" - replace the hostname and port
with the values provided to you by EMR Direct. The Username is your Direct Address. Do not 
enter the server URL into your browser address bar, as this will not work.

3. Specify the LibreEHR user who will receive notification of new incoming Direct messages. 
Enter their LibreEHR username in the notification user field.

4. Specify the interval for automatic message checking; we suggest 5 or 10 minutes as a
starting point, but installations processing a large number of Direct messages may want a 
shorter interval. To disable automatic message checking through LibreEHR's background service
manager, set the interval to 0 (zero). Disabling automatic checking would be appropriate 
if message checking is managed through another mechanism, such as a system cron job.

5. Optionally check ""phiMail Allow CCD Send"" and/or ""phiMail Allow CCR Send"" to enable
the Transmit feature for these data types. If you do not select at least one of these,
LibreEHR will operate in a receive-only mode.

6. Click the ""Save"" button.

7. Confirm that a valid Notification Email Address is set in the Administration::
Globals::Notifications tab to receive error notifications from the Direct Messaging service.

8. Install the EMR Direct trust anchor certificate.  

Note: This is *not* your Direct certificate; it is the trust anchor for the SSL 
certificate issued to our servers, and is used only to validate the SSL certificate 
presented by the phiMail server on the other side of LibreEHR's connection.  Your Direct private
key and certificate are managed by the phiMail Server and are not installed in LibreEHR.
Your Direct certificate is made availabe for your review by EMR Direct, but you will not
need to install it anywhere.

For added security, the trust anchor for the phiMail Server should be installed in the LibreEHR 
installation tree at:

[installation_root]/sites/[site_id]/documents/phimail_server_pem/phimail_server.pem

This phimail_server_pem directory and its contents should be readable by the the 
webserver process, but only writable by trusted local users. The certificate file 
itself must be PEM encoded. You can identify a PEM encoded certificate file because 
it begins with the text ""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"". Although LibreEHR will connect 
to phiMail servers without installing this certificate, this is a required configuration 
step for all production  accounts to ensure that you are connecting to the correct 
server. You can obtain the correct certificate at the following URLs:

  a. Test accounts: http://certs.emrdirect.com/EMRDirectTestCA.crt
     Important: Don't forget to rename the file to phimail_server.pem and install it
     in the correct directory.

  b. Production accounts: https://www.phicert.com/certs/phiCertDirectRootCA.crt
     Important: The production root must be converted to PEM format as follows:
     $ openssl x509 -in phiCertDirectRootCA.crt -inform DER -out phimail_server.pem
     Don't forget to install phimail_server.pem in the correct directory. As an added
     security measure, please call us to confirm the thumbprint on this certificate.

G. Debugging background connections to the server.

You may review the connection activity to the server by Selecting Administration::Other::Logs,
selecting ""direct-message"" in the ""Name of events:"" drop-down menu, and clicking ""[Refresh]"".
If the background service is succesfully connecting, you will see ""message check completed""
events in the log as well as any message related entries (see below for instructions to
view more detailed message related status information). If you see no entries, make sure that
the background service is enabled (See F.4 above). If you see ""could not connect to server""
entries, each entry will also contain an error code:

  C1: phiMail is disabled in the global configuration. Fix: enable.
  C2: the phiMail server URL entered in the global configuration is invalid. Fix: Confirm
      the URL has been entered correctly. It should be of the form 
      ""ssl://server.example.com:32541"".
  C3: unable to create stream context. Fix: Usually this is because the server certificate 
      file installed in F.8 above is not the correct certificate or is in the wrong format.
  C4: failed to open connection. Fix: Confirm you Internet service and local DNS servers are
      online and your firewall is not blocking connections to the phiMail Server.

H. Checking the status and history of the Direct Messaging Service in LibreEHR:
Administrators may view the status of the service by Selecting Reports::Services::Background 
Services from the main LibreEHR left navigation bar. The ""View Log"" link on this page or 
Reports::Services::Direct Message Log will open the messaging history log showing each message 
sent or received and the current status of that message (Received, Sent, Delivery Confirmed, 
or Failed).

I. Note of message status messages: Receiving message status updates requires that Direct message
checking be enabled. When receiving messages, the phiMail back-end is fully compliant with the 
Direct messaging protocols to notify the sender and provide final delivery confirmation, but 
please note that  many other Direct providers do not yet support these features. If a message 
is sent to a recipient using one of these other systems, LibreEHR probably won't ever receive a 
final delivery confirmation for that message.

J. How to use the Direct Messaging Features in LibreEHR:

1. Sending:
When the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, an additional ""Transmit"" button will
appear in the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) and/or Continuity of Care Document (CCD) block 
of the Reports section in both the Patient Portal and the Patient pane of the main provider 
interface. 

To transmit a CCR or CCD, first click the ""Transmit"" button. This will open a small dialog 
immediately below the button with a form field to enter the intended recipient's Direct Address. 
Clicking ""Transmit"" again will hide the dialog.

A Direct Address should have the same form as a regular email address, e.g. 
jonesclinic@direct.example.com. Enter the address in the field and click the ""Send"" button 
immediately to the right of the field. Only a single recipient may be specified in the field.
The Send button will be temporarily disabled while LibreEHR is communicating with the phiMail 
server. This will only work for properly-configured Direct addresses. Attempts to send to a 
regular email address or Direct address outside of our test mode ""trust sandbox"" will fail
during testing. Production accounts have wide interoperability with other Direct service
providers. Should you encounter a trust community with which LibreEHR does not interoperate,
please let us know at support@emrdirect.com.

LibreEHR will then display a status message immediately below the Address field, the 
success or failure of the message transmission, or an error message. If the message is
successfully submitted to the server, the Address field will be cleared to prevent accidental
re-transmission. If multiple recipients are required, the next recipient can now be entered.

If you receive an error message, it will be followed by an error code. For a discussion
of error codes beginning with the letter ""C"" please see section G above. Error codes
beginning with ""EC"" are listed here:

  EC 1: phiMail disabled in global configuration. Fix: enable.
  EC 4: authentication failure. Fix: The Username and Password entered in the
        global configuration must be corrected.
  EC 5: request to add text failed. Fix: Confirm total message length < 5MB.
  EC 6: problem sending the text. Fix: Confirm your local network connectivity is stable.
  EC 7: request to add clinical document failed. Fix: see EC 5.
  EC 8: problem sending the clinical document. Fix: see EC 6.

2. Receiving:
When the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, and message checking is enabled either 
through the background services manager of another mechanism, LibreEHR will automatically process 
message status updates and new messages. Status updates will be reflected immediately in the 
Direct Messaging log. Additionally, if a ""Failed"" notification is received for a previously sent 
message, a regular email message will be generated to the Notification Email Address specified 
in the Notifications tab of the Global Settings panel (accessed by selecting Administration::
Globals from the main left navigation menu).

New Direct messages will be processed as follows. A new ""Patient Note"" will be generated and 
sent to the phiMail notification user specified in the Connectors tab of the Global settings. 
The patient note will contain information about the message, including any text at the beginning 
of the message from the sender. Any attachments (and any non-text content) will be automatically 
converted to separate LibreEHR Documents, which will be referenced in the new Patient Note.  
The Documents and the Patient Note are initially created without an assigned patient. 

At this time, the envisioned workflow is that the notification user will review the message text
and any included Documents to determine which patient the content belongs to and will then set the 
patient using the existing Patient Note interface for choosing a patient. Once the patient is sent, 
the Patient Note can be forwarded to another provider or staff member as appropriate using the 
existing forwarding mechanism for Patient Notes. The unassigned Documents can be viewed by Selecting 
Miscellaneous::New Documents from the main left navigation menu, which opens a Documents list. Once 
the specified document is opened, the user can optionally categorize the document and, when 
appropriate, assign the document to a specific patient using the ""Move to Patient #"" feature in the 
Documents interface.

Edit on GitHub
Navigation
The Desktop App exercises relatively strict control over the user’s ability to navigate through the web. This is done for a few reasons:
Security:
Since we expose certain Electron (and therefore NodeJS) APIs to the front-end application, we want to be in control of what scripts are run in the front-end. We make a concerted effort to lock down the exposed APIs to only what is necessary; however, to avoid any privacy or security breaches, it’s best to avoid allowing the user to navigate to any page that isn’t explicitly trusted.
User Experience:
Our application is ONLY designed to work with the Mattermost Web App and thus allowing the user to navigate to other places that are not the Web App is not a supported use case, and could create some undesirable effects.
Internal navigation
The Mattermost Web App is self-contained, with the majority of links provided by
react-router
and thus most navigation is handled by that module. However, in the Desktop App, we have a major feature that allows users to navigate between distinct tabs bound to the same server. There are two ways that this style of navigation happens in the Web App:
A user clicks on a link provided by the
react-router
Link
component
The application calls
browserHistory.push
directly within the Web App based on the user action
Both of these methods will make use of the
browserHistory
module within the Web App.
When one of the above methods is used, normally the Web App would update the browser’s URL and change the state of the page. In the Desktop App, we instead send the arguments of the call to
browserHistory.push
up to the Electron Main Process. The information is received at the method
WindowManager.handleBrowserHistoryPush
, where we perform the following actions:
Clean the path name by removing any part of the server’s subpath pathname.
When the arguments are sent up to the Desktop App, it includes the subpath of the server hosting it.
As an example, if the server URL is
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, any path that is received will start with
/mattermost
and we will need to remove that component. The same would be true for any other path following the origin
http://server-1.com
.
Retrieve the view matching the path name
After removing the leading subpath (if applicable), we check to see if a portion of the path matches one of the other tabs, signally that we will need to switch to that tab.
For server
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, if the pathname is
/mattermost/boards/board1
, we would get the
Boards
view matching the server.
Display the correct view and send the cleaned path to its renderer process
We then explicitly display the new view if it’s not currently in focus. If it’s closed, we open it and load the corresponding URL with the provided path.
Exception
: If we’re redirecting to the root of the application and the user is not logged in, it will generate an unnecessary refresh. In this case, we do not send the path name down.
External navigation
For the cases where a user wants to navigate away from the Web App to an external site, we generally want to direct the user outside of the Desktop App and have them open their default web browser and use the external site in that application.
In order to achieve this, we need to explicitly handle every other link and method of navigation that is available to an Electron renderer process. Fortunately, Electron provides a few listeners that help us with that:
will-navigate
is an event that fires when the URL is changed for a given renderer process. Attaching a listener for this event allows us to prevent the navigation if desired.
NOTE: The event will not fire for in-page navigations or updating
window.location.hash
.
did-start-navigation
is another renderer process event that will fire once the page has started navigating. We can use this event to perform any actions when a certain URL is visited.
new-window
is an event that will fire when the user tries to open a new window or tab. This commonly will fire when the user clicks on a link marked
target=_blank
. We attach this listener using the
setWindowOpenHandler
and will allow us to
allow
or
deny
the opening as we desire.
In our application, we define all of these listeners in the
webContentEvents
module, and we attach them whenever a new

New window handling
Our new window handler will
deny
the opening of a new Electron window if any of the following cases are true:
Malformed URL:
Depending on the case, it will outright ignore it (if the URL could not be parsed), or it will open the user’s default browser if it is somehow invalid in another way.
Untrusted Protocol:
If the URL does not match an allowed protocol (allowed protocols include
http
,
https
, and any other protocol that was explicitly allowed by the user).
In this case, it will ask the user whether the protocol should be allowed, and if so will open the URL in the user’s default application that corresponds to that protocol.
Unknown Site:
If the URL does not match the root of a configured server, it will always try to open the link in the user’s default browser.
If the URL DOES match the root of a configured server, we still will deny the window opening for a few cases:
If the URL matches the public files route (
/api/v4/public/files/*
)
If the URL matches the image proxy route (
/api/v4/image/*
)
If the URL matches the help route (
/help/*
)
For these cases, we will open the link in the user’s browser.
Deep Link Case
: If the URL doesn’t match any of the above routes, but is still a valid configured server, we will generally treat is as the deep link cause, and will instead attempt to show the correct tab as well as navigate to the corresponding URL within the app.
There are two cases where we do allow the application to open a new window:
If the URL matches the
devtools:
protocol, so that we can open the Chrome Developer Tools.
If the URL is a valid configured server URL that corresponds to the plugins route (
/plugins/*
). In these cases we allow a single popup per tab to be opened for certain plugins to do things like OAuth (e.g. GitHub or JIRA).
Any other case will be automatically denied for security reasons.
Links within the same window
By default, the Mattermost Web App marks any link external to its application as
target=_blank
, so that the application doesn’t try to open it in the same window. Any other links should therefore be internal to the application.
We
deny
any sort of in-window navigation with the following exceptions: if the link is a
mailto:
link (which always opens the default mail program), OR if we are in the custom login flow.
Custom login flow
In order to facilitate logging into to the app using an external provider (e.g. Okta) in the same way that one would in the browser, we add an exception to the navigation flow that bypasses the
will-navigate
check.
When a user clicks on a login link that redirects them to a matching URL scheme (listed
here
), we will activate the custom login flow. The URL
MUST
still be internal to the application before we activate this flow, or any URL matching this pattern would allow the app to circumvent the navigation protection.
While the current window is in the custom login flow, all links that emit the
will-navigate
event will be allowed. Anything that opens a new window will still be restricted based on the rules for new windows. We leave the custom login flow once the app has navigated back to an URL internal to the application

",groq:deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b,input\Mattermost_Architecture\Navigation.txt,"{""file_name"": ""Navigation.txt"", ""full_cleaned_text"": ""Edit on GitHub\nNavigation\nThe Desktop App exercises relatively strict control over the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to navigate through the web. This is done for a few reasons:\nSecurity:\nSince we expose certain Electron (and therefore NodeJS) APIs to the front-end application, we want to be in control of what scripts are run in the front-end. We make a concerted effort to lock down the exposed APIs to only what is necessary; however, to avoid any privacy or security breaches, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best to avoid allowing the user to navigate to any page that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explicitly trusted.\nUser Experience:\nOur application is ONLY designed to work with the Mattermost Web App and thus allowing the user to navigate to other places that are not the Web App is not a supported use case, and could create some undesirable effects.\nInternal navigation\nThe Mattermost Web App is self-contained, with the majority of links provided by\nreact-router\nand thus most navigation is handled by that module. However, in the Desktop App, we have a major feature that allows users to navigate between distinct tabs bound to the same server. There are two ways that this style of navigation happens in the Web App:\nA user clicks on a link provided by the\nreact-router\nLink\ncomponent\nThe application calls\nbrowserHistory.push\ndirectly within the Web App based on the user action\nBoth of these methods will make use of the\nbrowserHistory\nmodule within the Web App.\nWhen one of the above methods is used, normally the Web App would update the browser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s URL and change the state of the page. In the Desktop App, we instead send the arguments of the call to\nbrowserHistory.push\nup to the Electron Main Process. The information is received at the method\nWindowManager.handleBrowserHistoryPush\n, where we perform the following actions:\nClean the path name by removing any part of the server\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subpath pathname.\nWhen the arguments are sent up to the Desktop App, it includes the subpath of the server hosting it.\nAs an example, if the server URL is\nhttp://server-1.com/mattermost\n, any path that is received will start with\n/mattermost\nand we will need to remove that component. The same would be true for any other path following the origin\nhttp://server-1.com\n.\nRetrieve the view matching the path name\nAfter removing the leading subpath (if applicable), we check to see if a portion of the path matches one of the other tabs, signally that we will need to switch to that tab.\nFor server\nhttp://server-1.com/mattermost\n, if the pathname is\n/mattermost/boards/board1\n, we would get the\nBoards\nview matching the server.\nDisplay the correct view and send the cleaned path to its renderer process\nWe then explicitly display the new view if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not currently in focus. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closed, we open it and load the corresponding URL with the provided path.\nException\n: If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re redirecting to the root of the application and the user is not logged in, it will generate an unnecessary refresh. In this case, we do not send the path name down.\nExternal navigation\nFor the cases where a user wants to navigate away from the Web App to an external site, we generally want to direct the user outside of the Desktop App and have them open their default web browser and use the external site in that application.\nIn order to achieve this, we need to explicitly handle every other link and method of navigation that is available to an Electron renderer process. Fortunately, Electron provides a few listeners that help us with that:\nwill-navigate\nis an event that fires when the URL is changed for a given renderer process. Attaching a listener for this event allows us to prevent the navigation if desired.\nNOTE: The event will not fire for in-page navigations or updating\nwindow.location.hash\n.\ndid-start-navigation\nis another renderer process event that will fire once the page has started navigating. We can use this event to perform any actions when a certain URL is visited.\nnew-window\nis an event that will fire when the user tries to open a new window or tab. This commonly will fire when the user clicks on a link marked\ntarget=_blank\n. We attach this listener using the\nsetWindowOpenHandler\nand will allow us to\nallow\nor\ndeny\nthe opening as we desire.\nIn our application, we define all of these listeners in the\nwebContentEvents\nmodule, and we attach them whenever a new\nwebContents\nobject is create to make sure that all renderer processes are correctly secured and set up correctly.\nNew window handling\nOur new window handler will\ndeny\nthe opening of a new Electron window if any of the following cases are true:\nMalformed URL:\nDepending on the case, it will outright ignore it (if the URL could not be parsed), or it will open the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default browser if it is somehow invalid in another way.\nUntrusted Protocol:\nIf the URL does not match an allowed protocol (allowed protocols include\nhttp\n,\nhttps\n, and any other protocol that was explicitly allowed by the user).\nIn this case, it will ask the user whether the protocol should be allowed, and if so will open the URL in the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default application that corresponds to that protocol.\nUnknown Site:\nIf the URL does not match the root of a configured server, it will always try to open the link in the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s default browser.\nIf the URL DOES match the root of a configured server, we still will deny the window opening for a few cases:\nIf the URL matches the public files route (\n/api/v4/public/files/*\n)\nIf the URL matches the image proxy route (\n/api/v4/image/*\n)\nIf the URL matches the help route (\n/help/*\n)\nFor these cases, we will open the link in the user\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s browser.\nDeep Link Case\n: If the URL doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match any of the above routes, but is still a valid configured server, we will generally treat is as the deep link cause, and will instead attempt to show the correct tab as well as navigate to the corresponding URL within the app.\nThere are two cases where we do allow the application to open a new window:\nIf the URL matches the\ndevtools:\nprotocol, so that we can open the Chrome Developer Tools.\nIf the URL is a valid configured server URL that corresponds to the plugins route (\n/plugins/*\n).

Getting Started
Choosing an Instance
If you are used to sites like Reddit, then Lemmy works in a fundamentally different way. Instead of a single website like reddit.com, there are many different websites (called instances). These are operated by different people, have different topics and rules. Nevertheless, posts created in one instance can directly be seen by users who are registered on another. Its basically like email, but for social media.

This means before using Lemmy and registering an account, you need to pick an instance. For this you can browse the instance list and look for one that matches your topics of interest. You can also see if the rules match your expectations, and how many users there are. It is better to avoid very big or very small instances. But don't worry too much about this choice, you can always create another account on a different instance later.

[instance list screenshot]

Registration
Once you choose an instance, it's time to create your account. To do this, click sign up in the top right of the page, or click the top right button on mobile to open a menu with sign up link.

[registration page screenshot]

On the signup page you need to enter a few things:

Username: How do you want to be called? This name can not be changed and is unique within an instance. Later you can also set a displayname which can be freely changed. If your desired username is taken, consider choosing a different instance where it is still available.
Email: Your email address. This is used for password resets and notifications (if enabled). Providing an email address is usually optional, but admins may choose to make it mandatory. In this case you will have to wait for a confirmation mail and click the link after completing this form.
Password: The password for logging in to your account. Make sure to choose a long and unique password which isn't used on any other website.
Verify password: Repeat the same password from above to ensure that it was entered correctly.
There are also a few optional fields, which you may need to fill in depending on the instance configuration:

Question/Answer: Instance admins can set an arbitrary question which needs to be answered in order to create an account. This is often used to prevent spam bots from signing up. After submitting the form, you will need to wait for some time until the answer is approved manually before you can login.
Code: A captcha which is easy to solve for humans but hard for bots. Enter the letters and numbers that you see in the text box, ignoring uppercase or lowercase. Click the refresh button if you are unable to read a character. The play button plays an audio version of the captcha.
Show NSFW content: Here you can choose if content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only) should be shown.
When you are done, press the sign up button.

It depends on the instance configuration when you can login and start using the account. In case the email is mandatory, you need to wait for the confirmation email and click the link first. In case ""Question/Answer"" is present, you need to wait for an admin to manually review and approve your registration. If you have problems with the registration, try to get in contact with the admin for support. You can also choose a different instance to sign up if your primary choice does not work.

Following Communities
After logging in to your new account, its time to follow communities that you are interested in. For this you can click on the communities link at the top of the page (on mobile, you need to click the menu icon on the top right first). You will see a list of communities which can be filtered by subscribed, local or all. Local communities are those which are hosted on the same site where you are signed in, while all also contains federated communities from other instances. In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.

Another way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the ""sidebar"" button on mobile.

These previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.

Setting up Your Profile
Before you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to ""settings"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:

Displayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time
Bio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown
Matrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat
Avatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts
Banner: A header image for your profile page
On this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:

Blocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.
Interface language: Which language the user interface should use.
Languages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select ""Undetermined"" to see them.
Theme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.
Type: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.
Sort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.
Show NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only).
Show Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.
Show Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.
Bot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically
Show Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.
Show Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.
Show Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.
Send notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.
Start Posting
Finally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.

Other than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as ""not safe for work"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.

One more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them:

Who is it for?
This project is for people who want to document their lives and those who have difficulty remembering details about the lives of people they care about.

We’ve also had a lot of positive reviews from people with Asperger syndrome, Alzheimer’s disease, and introverts who use our app every day.

What Monica isn’t
Monica is not a social network and it never will be. It’s not meant to be social. It’s designed to be the opposite: it’s for your eyes only.
Monica is not a smart assistant. It won’t guess what you want to do. It’s actually pretty dumb: it will only send you emails for the things you asked to be reminded of.
Monica does not have built-in AI with integrations like ChatGPT.
Monica is not a tool that will scan your data and do nasty things with it. It’s your data, your server, do whatever you want with it. You’re in control of your data.
Contribute
Do you want to lend a hand? That’s great! We accept contributions from everyone, regardless of form.

Here are some of the things you can do to help.

Contribute as a community
Unlike Fight Club, the best way to help is to actually talk about Monica as much as you can in blog posts and articles, or on social media.
You can answer questions in the issue tracker to help other community members.
You can financially support Monica’s development on Patreon or by subscribing to a paid account.
Contribute as a developer
Read our Contribution Guide.
Install the developer version locally so you can start contributing.
Look for issues labelled ‘Bugs’ if you are looking to have an immediate impact on Monica.
Look for issues labelled ‘Help Wanted’. These are issues that you can solve relatively easily.
Look for issues labelled ’Good First Issue’. These issues are for people who want to contribute, but try to work on a small feature first.
If you are an advanced developer, you can try to tackle issues labelled ‘Feature Requests’. These are harder to do and will require a lot of back-and-forth with the repository administrator to make sure we are going to the right direction with the product.
Principles, vision, goals and strategy
We want to use technology in a way that does not harm human relationships, unlike big social networks.

Principles
Monica has a few principles.

It should help improve relationships.
It should be simple to use, simple to contribute to, simple to understand, extremely simple to maintain.
It is not a social network and never will be.
It is not and never will be ad-supported.
Users are not and never will be tracked.
It should be transparent.
It should be open-source.
It should do one thing (documenting your life) extremely well, and nothing more.
It should be well documented.
Vision
Monica’s vision is to help people have more meaningful relationships.

Goals
We want to provide a platform that is:

really easy to use: we value simplicity over anything else.
open-source: we believe everyone should be able to contribute to this tool, and see for themselves that nothing nasty is done behind the scenes that would go against the best interests of the users. We also want to leverage the community to build attractive features and do things that would not be possible otherwise.
easy to contribute to: we want to keep the codebase as simple as possible. This has two big advantages: anyone can contribute, and it’s easily maintainable on the long run.
available everywhere: Monica should be able to run on any desktop OS or mobile phone easily. This will be made possible by making sure the tool is easily installable by anyone who wants to either contribute or host the platform themselves.
Why Open Source?
Why is Monica open source? Is it risky? Could someone steal my code and use it to start a for-profit business that could hurt my own? Why reveal our strategy to the world? We’ve already received these kinds of questions in our emails.

The answer is simple: yes, you can fork Monica and create a competing project, make money from it (even if the license is not ideal for that) and we won’t be aware. But that’s okay, we don’t mind.

We wanted to open source Monica for several reasons:

We believe that this tool can really change people’s lives. We aim to make money from this project, but also want everyone to benefit. Open sourcing it will help Monica become much bigger than we imagine. We believe the software should follow our vision, but we must be humble enough to recognize that ideas come from everywhere and people may have better ideas than us.
You can’t make something great alone. While Monica could become a company and hire a bunch of super smart people to work on it, you can’t beat the manpower of an entire community. Open sourcing the product means bugs will be fixed faster, features will be developed faster, and more importantly, developers will be able to contribute to a tool that positively changes their own lives and the lives of other people.
Doing things in a transparent way leads to formidable things. People respect the project more when they can see how it’s being worked on. You can’t hide nasty things in the code. You can’t do things behind the backs of your users. Doing everything in the open is a major driving force that motivates you to keep doing what’s right.
Once you’ve created a community of passionate developers around your project, you’ve won. Developers are powerful influencers: they create apps, discuss your product on forums, and share it with their networks. Nurture your relationship with developers – users will follow.

Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand what's going on. The text seems to be about two different platforms: Lemmy and Monica. \n\nFirst, I'll focus on the Lemmy section. It talks about choosing an instance, registering an account, following communities, setting up a profile, and starting to post. During registration, users provide a username, email, password, and might have to fill out a question/answer or a CAPTCHA. They can also choose to show NSFW content. After logging in, they can follow communities, set up their profile with a display name, bio, avatar, etc., and start posting or sending private messages.\n\nSo, for actions, I see that the system is collecting data when the user registers and when they use the platform. They're using this data for account management, functionality, and authentication. The data types involved are contact data like email and username, and account information like passwords. There's also optional data like bio and avatar, which might fall under biographical data. The purposes here are account management, functionality, and authentication.\n\nNow, looking at the Monica section. Monica is a personal relationship management system where users can document their lives, manage contacts, set reminders, upload photos, and more. It's emphasized that Monica is not a social network and doesn't track users. It's open-source and focused on privacy.\n\nIn this part, actions include collecting contact data like names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, relationships, and notes. They also manage activities, tasks, and upload documents or photos. The purposes here are managing relationships, providing reminders, and functionality. Data types are contact data, biographical data, and maybe some usage data for reminders and such.\n\nPutting it all together, I need to structure the annotations with actions, data types, purposes, and stories for each section. I'll separate them into Lemmy and Monica sections, each with their own annotations and rationales.\n</think>\n\n<Actions> Collect, Use </Actions> \n<Data Types> Email address, Account information, Username, Password, Biographical Data, Contact Data </Data Types> \n<Purposes> Account management, Functionality, Authentication </Purposes> \n<Stories> We collect Email address, Username, Password, and other Account information for Account management.

The system's functionality is designed to assist users in documenting their lives without tracking them. </R>""","""<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at the user's query where they want me to annotate a given text with specific metadata related to privacy. They provided a detailed example and expect me to follow that structure. Let me start by understanding the task thoroughly.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the actions, data types, purposes, and stories from the text. The actions are Collect, Use, and Share. The data types are more specific, like Contact Data which includes Email address and others. Purposes include things like Account management or Functionality. Stories should tie these elements together in a concise narrative.\n\nLooking at the provided text, it's about setting up a Lemmy account and using Monica, a personal relationship management tool. I'll go through each section to extract relevant information.\n\nIn the Lemmy registration part, users provide a username, email, and password. The email is used for password resets and notifications. So, the actions here are Collect and Use, with data types being Email address and Account information. The purposes are Account management, Functionality, and Authentication.\n\nFor Monica, it's about documenting personal relationships. The tool allows users to add contacts, set reminders, upload photos, etc. This involves Collecting Contact Data, Biographical Data, and Usage Data. The purposes here are Functionality, Security, and Account management.\n\nNow, I need to structure these findings into the specified XML format. Each category—Actions, Data Types, Purposes, Stories—needs to be clearly separated. I'll make sure to use only the allowed categories and subcategories as provided.\n\nI should also explain my rationale after the annotations, highlighting why each choice was made. For instance, explaining how the collection of email addresses is for account management and functionality.\n\nFinally, I'll ensure the response is properly formatted with the <R> tag separating annotations from the rationale. I'll double-check that each part adheres to the user's instructions and the provided example to maintain consistency and accuracy.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \n  Collect  \n  Use  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \n  Email address  \n  Account information  \n  Contact Data  \n  Biographical Data  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \n  Account management  \n  Functionality  \n  Authentication  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n  We collect Email address and account information for account management.

Navigation
The Desktop App exercises relatively strict control over the userâ€™s ability to navigate through the web. This is done for a few reasons:
Security:
Since we expose certain Electron (and therefore NodeJS) APIs to the front-end application, we want to be in control of what scripts are run in the front-end. We make a concerted effort to lock down the exposed APIs to only what is necessary; however, to avoid any privacy or security breaches, itâ€™s best to avoid allowing the user to navigate to any page that isnâ€™t explicitly trusted.
User Experience:
Our application is ONLY designed to work with the Mattermost Web App and thus allowing the user to navigate to other places that are not the Web App is not a supported use case, and could create some undesirable effects.
Internal navigation
The Mattermost Web App is self-contained, with the majority of links provided by
react-router
and thus most navigation is handled by that module. However, in the Desktop App, we have a major feature that allows users to navigate between distinct tabs bound to the same server. There are two ways that this style of navigation happens in the Web App:
A user clicks on a link provided by the
react-router
Link
component
The application calls
browserHistory.push
directly within the Web App based on the user action
Both of these methods will make use of the
browserHistory
module within the Web App.
When one of the above methods is used, normally the Web App would update the browserâ€™s URL and change the state of the page. In the Desktop App, we instead send the arguments of the call to
browserHistory.push
up to the Electron Main Process. The information is received at the method
WindowManager.handleBrowserHistoryPush
, where we perform the following actions:
Clean the path name by removing any part of the serverâ€™s subpath pathname.
When the arguments are sent up to the Desktop App, it includes the subpath of the server hosting it.
As an example, if the server URL is
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, any path that is received will start with
/mattermost
and we will need to remove that component. The same would be true for any other path following the origin
http://server-1.com
.
Retrieve the view matching the path name
After removing the leading subpath (if applicable), we check to see if a portion of the path matches one of the other tabs, signally that we will need to switch to that tab.
For server
http://server-1.com/mattermost
, if the pathname is
/mattermost/boards/board1
, we would get the
Boards
view matching the server.
Display the correct view and send the cleaned path to its renderer process
We then explicitly display the new view if itâ€™s not currently in focus. If itâ€™s closed, we open it and load the corresponding URL with the provided path.
Exception
: If weâ€™re redirecting to the root of the application and the user is not logged in, it will generate an unnecessary refresh. In this case, we do not send the path name down.
External navigation
For the cases where a user wants to navigate away from the Web App to an external site, we generally want to direct the user outside of the Desktop App and have them open their default web browser and use the external site in that application.
In order to achieve this, we need to explicitly handle every other link and method of navigation that is available to an Electron renderer process. Fortunately, Electron provides a few listeners that help us with that:
will-navigate
is an event that fires when the URL is changed for a given renderer process. Attaching a listener for this event allows us to prevent the navigation if desired.
NOTE: The event will not fire for in-page navigations or updating
window.location.hash
.
did-start-navigation
is another renderer process event that will fire once the page has started navigating. We can use this event to perform any actions when a certain URL is visited.
new-window
is an event that will fire when the user tries to open a new window or tab. This commonly will fire when the user clicks on a link marked
target=_blank
. We attach this listener using the
setWindowOpenHandler
and will allow us to
allow
or
deny
the opening as we desire.
In our application, we define all of these listeners in the
webContentEvents
module, and we attach them whenever a new
webContents
object is create to make sure that all renderer processes are correctly secured and set up correctly.
New window handling
Our new window handler will
deny
the opening of a new Electron window if any of the following cases are true:
Malformed URL:
Depending on the case, it will outright ignore it (if the URL could not be parsed), or it will open the userâ€™s default browser if it is somehow invalid in another way.
Untrusted Protocol:
If the URL does not match an allowed protocol (allowed protocols include
http
,
https
, and any other protocol that was explicitly allowed by the user).
In this case, it will ask the user whether the protocol should be allowed, and if so will open the URL in the userâ€™s default application that corresponds to that protocol.
Unknown Site:
If the URL does not match the root of a configured server, it will always try to open the link in the userâ€™s default browser.
If the URL DOES match the root of a configured server, we still will deny the window opening for a few cases:
If the URL matches the public files route (
/api/v4/public/files/*
)
If the URL matches the image proxy route (
/api/v4/image/*
)
If the URL matches the help route (
/help/*
)
For these cases, we will open the link in the userâ€™s browser.
Deep Link Case
: If the URL doesnâ€™t match any of the above routes, but is still a valid configured server, we will generally treat is as the deep link cause, and will instead attempt to show the correct tab as well as navigate to the corresponding URL within the app.
There are two cases where we do allow the application to open a new window:
If the URL matches the
devtools:
protocol, so that we can open the Chrome Developer Tools.
If the URL is a valid configured server URL that corresponds to the plugins route (
/plugins/*
). In these cases we allow a single popup per tab to be opened for certain plugins to do things like OAuth (e.g. GitHub or JIRA).
Any other case will be automatically denied for security reasons.
Links within the same window
By default, the Mattermost Web App marks any link external to its application as
target=_blank
, so that the application doesnâ€™t try to open it in the same window. Any other links should therefore be internal to the application.
We
deny
any sort of in-window navigation with the following exceptions: if the link is a
mailto:
link (which always opens the default mail program), OR if we are in the custom login flow.
Custom login flow
In order to facilitate logging into to the app using an external provider (e.g. Okta) in the same way that one would in the browser, we add an exception to the navigation flow that bypasses the
will-navigate
check.
When a user clicks on a login link that redirects them to a matching URL scheme (listed
here
), we will activate the custom login flow. The URL
MUST
still be internal to the application before we activate this flow, or any URL matching this pattern would allow the app to circumvent the navigation protection.
While the current window is in the custom login flow, all links that emit the
will-navigate
event will be allowed. Anything that opens a new window will still be restricted based on the rules for new windows. We leave the custom login flow once the app has navigated back to an URL internal to the application

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them: 
Privacy stories are built explicitly from our labelled privacy behaviors in the format of we (action) (data type) for (purpose)<Actions> use </Actions> <Data Types> usage data </Data Types> <Purposes> Functionality, security </Purposes>1. We use usage data for Functionality. We use usage data for security.. </Stories>
Architecture
This chapter contains an in-depth view of the architecture of the system. If you don't understand everything on the first reading, don't fret! Understanding how the basic system fits together is the most important thing you need for now.

#Technical Overview
OpenMRS is a framework built upon Java and other related frameworks. It is based on a modular architecture which consists of a core application and optional modules which provide additional functionality to the core workflows.


The key architectural components of the OpenMRS core can be depicted as follows:

An Overview of OpenMRS
An Overview of OpenMRS
The backbone of OpenMRS lies in its core API. The OpenMRS API has methods for all of the basic functions such as adding/updating a patient, encounter, observation, etc. Methods which enable this functionality are provided in service layer classes.

#The Source Code Structure
In OpenMRS framework and modules, there are different levels in the code architecture. The OpenMRS source code is divided into three main segments:

The User Interface (presentation)
The Service Layer
The Data Access layer
This layering isolates various system responsibilities from one another, to improve both system development and maintenance.

#The Data Access layer

The Data Access layer is an abstraction layer from the actual data model and its changes. It uses Hibernate as the Object Relational mapping tool, and Liquibase to manage relational database changes in a database-independent way.


The relationships between our domain objects and database tables are mapped using a mixture of Hibernate annotations and XML mapping files. The data access layer is exposed to the service layer through interfaces, thereby shielding it from implementation details such as which object relational mapping tool is being used. see openmrs DataModel at openmrs university

#The Service layer
The Service layer is responsible for managing the business logic of the application. It is built around the Spring framework. The OpenMRS service layer classes make extensive use of the Spring framework for a number of tasks including the following:

Spring Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is used to provide separate cross cutting functions (for example: authentication, logging).
Spring Dependency Injection (DI) is used to provide dependencies between components.
Spring is used to manage transactions in between service layer classes


#User Interface layer
The User Interface layer for the legacy application is built upon Spring MVC, Direct Web Remoting (DWR), JSP and JavaScript. DWR is used for AJAX functionality and it provides the mapping between our Java objects and methods to JavaScript objects and methods respectively. JQuery is used to simplify the interactions with Javascript and the browser. Spring MVC is used to provide the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Our domain objects serve as the Model. We have a mixture of controllers that subclass Spring's SimpleFormControllers and those which use Spring's @Controller annotation. For the new reference application user interface, we no longer use Spring MVC, DWR or JSP, but heavily use Groovy, JQuery, AngularJS, and more.

#The Modular Architecture
At the heart of OpenMRS is a custom module framework which lets you extend and modify the default functionality of the OpenMRS core in accordance to your needs. Modules are also structured like the OpenMRS core, and consist of user interface, data access and service layers.

Some OpenMRS functionality is pulled out into modules instead of being written into the core application. This allows users to upgrade the content in those modules without having to wait for the next OpenMRS release. Currently, the only core module used in OpenMRS is the Logic Module.

#Associated Frameworks and Technology Stacks
#Hibernate
Hibernate is the object-relational mapping library used by OpenMRS. It allows users to describe the relationship between database tables and domain objects using xml configuration files or Java annotations.

Hibernate is also useful in managing dependencies between classes. As an example, the concept domain in the data model consists of tables named concept, concept_answer, concept_set and concept_name. It would be very difficult to keep up with where to store each part of the concept object and the relations between them if a user decides to update each table individually. However, using Hibernate, developers only need to concern themselves with the Concept object, and not the tables behind that object. The concept.hbm.xml mapping file does the work of knowing that the Concept object contains a collection of ConceptSet objects, a collection of ConceptName objects, etc.

However, also note that Hibernate enforces lazy loading - it will not load all associated objects until they are needed. For this reason, you must either fetch/save/manipulate your object in the same session (between one open/closeSession) or you must hydrate all object collections in the object by calling the getters (getConceptAnswers, getConceptNames, getSynonyms, etc).

#Spring MVC
OpenMRS strongly subscribes to the Model-View-Controller pattern. Most controllers included in the OpenMRS core will be SimpleFormControllers and be placed in the org.openmrs.web.controller package. However, some controllers have been rewritten to use Spring 2.5+ annotations, and we recommend that you use these in the future. The model is set up in the controller's formBackingObject, and processed/saved in the processFormSubmission and onSubmit methods. The jsp views are placed in /web/WEB-INF/view.

Furthermore, not all files served by the webapp are run through Spring. The /web/WEB-INF/web.xml file maps certain web page extensions to the SpringController. All *.form, *.htm, and *.list pages are mapped. The SpringController then uses the mappings in the openmrs-servlet.xml file to know which pages are mapping to which Controller.

There are no jsp pages that are accessed directly. If a page's url is /admin/patients/index.htm, the jsp will actually reside in /web/WEB-INF/view/admin/patients/index.jsp. This is necessary so that we can do the redirect with the SpringController. Because the file being accessed ends with .htm, the SpringController is invoked by the web server. When the SpringController sees the url, it simply replaces .htm with .jsp and looks for the file in /web/WEB-INF/view/ according to the jspViewResolver bean in openmrs-servlet.xml. If the page being accessed was patient.form, the mapping in the urlMapping bean would have told spring to use the PatientFormController and the patientForm.jsp file.

#Authentication and Authorization

OpenMRS has a very granulated permissions system. Every action is associated with a Privilege, which in turn can be grouped into Roles. Examples of such privileges are ""Add Patient"", ""Update Patient"", ""Delete Patient"", ""Add Concept"", ""Update Concept"", and more. A Role can also point to a list of inherited roles. The role inherits all privileges from that inherited role. In this way, hierarchies of roles are possible. A User contains only a collection of Roles, not Privileges. These privileges are enforced in the service layer using AOP annotations. In a way, this also enssures Confidentiality of patients' Data by putting restrictions on the data Access.


#Build Management
OpenMRS uses Apache Maven for build management of the OpenMRS core and modules.

All information regarding the module being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories, and required plug-ins are stored in the modules' pom.xml file.

Following release, these build artifacts are uploaded and maintained in a maven repository manager. A maven repository manager is used for this purpose due to a number of advantages that it provides. These advantages include:

Faster and more reliable builds
Improved collaboration
Component usage visibility
Enforcement of component standards
The Maven Repository used by OpenMRS is SonaType Nexus, which can be accessed at http://mavenrepo.openmrs.org/nexus/.
Artifacts maintained in the OpenMRS repository are:
#Releases
Maven built releases (1.8.0 and later)
Ant built releases (1.5.0 up to 1.7.X)
#Snapshots
Maven development versions
#Modules
Module releases
#3rd Party Artifacts
Libraries not found in other Maven repositories (HAPI)
Modified libraries (DWR, Hibernate, Liquibase, Simple XML)
Custom Maven plugins (OpenMRS omod plugin)
#Summary
As you read the next section, keep in mind the important parts from this chapter:

OpenMRS consists of a core system, with a modular architecture to extend its functionality.
There are three main layers to the system: User Interface (Presentation), Service Layer and Data Access Layer.
OpenMRS makes extensive use of a number of frameworks including Spring and Hibernate.
We use Apache Maven for build management, JIRA for issue management and Github for version control.
Authentication/Authorisation is ensured by grouping different priviledges into roles which then are assigned to defined users and in turn it ensures the confidentiality of patients data and security of the system.

",groq:deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b,input\openMRS\Architecture.txt,"{""file_name"": ""Architecture.txt"", ""full_cleaned_text"": ""Architecture\nThis chapter contains an in-depth view of the architecture of the system. If you don't understand everything on the first reading, don't fret! Understanding how the basic system fits together is the most important thing you need for now.\n\n#Technical Overview\nOpenMRS is a framework built upon Java and other related frameworks. It is based on a modular architecture which consists of a core application and optional modules which provide additional functionality to the core workflows.\n\n\nThe key architectural components of the OpenMRS core can be depicted as follows:\n\nAn Overview of OpenMRS\nAn Overview of OpenMRS\nThe backbone of OpenMRS lies in its core API. The OpenMRS API has methods for all of the basic functions such as adding/updating a patient, encounter, observation, etc. Methods which enable this functionality are provided in service layer classes.\n\n#The Source Code Structure\nIn OpenMRS framework and modules, there are different levels in the code architecture. The OpenMRS source code is divided into three main segments:\n\nThe User Interface (presentation)\nThe Service Layer\nThe Data Access layer\nThis layering isolates various system responsibilities from one another, to improve both system development and maintenance.\n\n#The Data Access layer\n\nThe Data Access layer is an abstraction layer from the actual data model and its changes. It uses Hibernate as the Object Relational mapping tool, and Liquibase to manage relational database changes in a database-independent way.\n\n\nThe relationships between our domain objects and database tables are mapped using a mixture of Hibernate annotations and XML mapping files. The data access layer is exposed to the service layer through interfaces, thereby shielding it from implementation details such as which object relational mapping tool is being used. see openmrs DataModel at openmrs university\n\n#The Service layer\nThe Service layer is responsible for managing the business logic of the application. It is built around the Spring framework. The OpenMRS service layer classes make extensive use of the Spring framework for a number of tasks including the following:\n\nSpring Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) is used to provide separate cross cutting functions (for example: authentication, logging).\nSpring Dependency Injection (DI) is used to provide dependencies between components.\nSpring is used to manage transactions in between service layer classes\n\n\n#User Interface layer\nThe User Interface layer for the legacy application is built upon Spring MVC, Direct Web Remoting (DWR), JSP and JavaScript. DWR is used for AJAX functionality and it provides the mapping between our Java objects and methods to JavaScript objects and methods respectively. JQuery is used to simplify the interactions with Javascript and the browser. Spring MVC is used to provide the Model-View-Controller design pattern. Our domain objects serve as the Model. We have a mixture of controllers that subclass Spring's SimpleFormControllers and those which use Spring's @Controller annotation. For the new reference application user interface, we no longer use Spring MVC, DWR or JSP, but heavily use Groovy, JQuery, AngularJS, and more.\n\n#The Modular Architecture\nAt the heart of OpenMRS is a custom module framework which lets you extend and modify the default functionality of the OpenMRS core in accordance to your needs.

The text is about the architecture of OpenMRS, a Java-based medical records system. It describes the system's layers, data access, service layer, user interface, and security features.\n\nLooking for actions mentioned: The text talks about using, collecting, and sharing data, but I need to map it to the allowed actions: Collect, Use, Share. It mentions managing business logic, handling data access, and controlling user navigation, which relate to using data for functionality and security.\n\nNext, data types. The text references patient data, which falls under Health Data. It also mentions usage data, which is about how users interact with the app. There's no mention of contact data, financial info, etc., so I'll focus on Health Data and Usage Data.\n\nFor purposes, the actions are done for functionality, security, and tracking. The system uses data to manage business logic and ensure security, so those are the main purposes.\n\nNow, creating stories. Each story should link actions, data types, and purposes. For example, using health data for functionality and security, and usage data for functionality and tracking.\n\nI'll structure the annotations, making sure each category is properly filled. Then, I'll explain why I chose each element, linking them back to the text.\n\nI should ensure that I only use the provided categories and that each story is concise and accurately reflects the text. I also need to format everything correctly with the XML tags as specified.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use, Share  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \nHealth Data:  \n  Patient Data  \nUsage Data:  \n  User Engagement  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \nFunctionality, Security, Tracking  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n1.

The system collects and uses health data (patient data) for core functionality and security purposes. It also collects and uses usage data (user engagement) to track interactions and ensure the system operates securely and efficiently.  \n</R>""","""<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to annotate this text about the OpenMRS architecture. The user provided a detailed response with annotations, but now I need to go through my own thought process as if I'm a novice trying to understand how to do this.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the text carefully. It's about OpenMRS, which is a medical records system built with Java and other frameworks. The text describes its architecture, layers, data access, service layer, UI, modules, and associated technologies like Hibernate, Spring MVC, etc. There's also a section on authentication and authorization, which is crucial for privacy.\n\nThe user wants me to annotate this text with specific categories: Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. The actions are Collect, Use, Share. Data Types include various subcategories like Contact Data, Health Data, etc. Purposes are things like Contact, Analytics, Customization, Advertisement, Security, etc. Stories should tie these together.\n\nStarting with Actions. The text talks about how the system manages data, handles navigation, and controls access. So the actions here would likely be \""Use\"" since the system is using data for functionality and security. There's no mention of collecting new data or sharing it, so \""Use\"" seems appropriate.\n\nNext, Data Types. The system deals with patient data, which includes health information. So \""Health Data\"" is a clear category. Also, since it's a web app, there's usage data like app interactions, so \""Usage Data\"" and its subcategory \""App Interactions\"" would fit. There's also mention of user roles and privileges, which relates to \""Account Information\"" like user IDs and roles.\n\nPurposes. The system uses data primarily for functionality, ensuring the app works as intended, and for security, protecting patient data and controlling access. So \""Functionality\"" and \""Security\"" are the main purposes here.\n\nStories. These should be concise, tying together actions, data types, and purposes. For example, using usage data for functionality and security. Also, using health data for functionality and security, and account information for security.\n\nNow, putting this all together. I need to make sure each annotation is correctly categorized and that the stories make sense in context. I should also provide a rationale for each choice, explaining why I selected those particular annotations.\n\nI think I've got a handle on it. Let me structure this properly with the correct XML tags and ensure each part is filled out as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>\nUse\n</Actions>\n\n<Data Types>\nHealth Data:\n  Medical Records:\n    Patient Information:\n</Data Types>\n\n<Purposes>\nFunctionality, Security\n</Purposes>\n\n<Stories>\nWe use health data for functionality. We use health data for security.\n</Stories>\n\n<R>\nThe text describes how OpenMRS uses health data to ensure functionality and security. The system manages patient records and controls access through roles and privileges, which ties into using health data for these purposes. The actions involve using the data rather than collecting or sharing it, hence the \""Use\"" action. The data types are specific to health and patient information, fitting under \""Health Data.\"" The purposes are clear in maintaining functionality and ensuring security, which are critical for a medical records system.\n</R>"""

note left of TrackPoint
As of OpenTracks version 3.15.0, all times are using device time.
Before that TrackPoint.time contained GPS time (determined by GPS hardware).
However, start/pause/stop events (also stored as TrackPoints) used device time.
end note

note right of Track
A track is an ordered collection of one or more segments (i.e., continuous parts of distance covered).
Segments may be started by a user (i.e., start a track recording, continue a paused track, or resume a track) as well as stopped by the user (i.e., pausing or stopping a recording).
Also segments may started automatically while recording (i.e., distance to previous location was to large).
Note that this finishes the previous segment.

Segment data is stored as TrackPoints (Type.SEGMENT_START_MANUAL, Type.SEGMENT_START_AUTOMATIC, or Type.SEGMENT_END_MANUAL).
Trackpoints with Type.SEGMENT_START_AUTOMATIC also mark the end of the previous segment.
All TrackPoints of Type.TRACKPOINT belong to the segment started by the prior TrackPoint with Type.SEGMENT_START_(MANUAL|AUTOMATIC).
Trackpoints of Type.SEGMENT_START_MANUAL or Type.SEGMENT_END_MANUAL do not contain location data or sensor data.

Tracks recorded prior to OpenTracks version 3.15.0, do neither begin with a Type.SEGMENT_START_MANUAL nor end with a Type.SEGMENT_END_MANUAL.

It seems like the system is collecting and using this data for functionality and authentication purposes.\n\nNext, I'll identify the data types. The tables mention session IDs, which fall under Usage Data. There's also an email address mentioned, so that's another data type to note.\n\nFor purposes, the primary goals here are functionality and authentication. The system uses the data to manage subscriptions and ensure proper authentication of sessions.\n\nNow, constructing the stories. The system collects session IDs and email addresses to manage subscriptions and authenticate users. It uses these details to ensure the notification system works correctly and securely.\n\nI need to make sure I only use the provided categories and format my annotations correctly. I'll structure them as Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories, followed by the rationale.\n\nIn the rationale, I'll explain how each annotation was derived from the text, linking actions to data collection and usage, data types to specific mentions, purposes to system functionality, and stories to the overall behavior of the system.\n</think>\n\n<Actions> Collect, Use </Actions>  \n<Data Types> Session ID, Email address </Data Types>  \n<Purposes> Functionality, Authentication </Purposes>  \n<Stories> We collect session ID and email address for functionality.

The purposes \""functionality\"" and \""authentication\"" are inferred from the system's need to manage subscriptions and secure access. The stories encapsulate how these actions, data types, and purposes interact within the system's operation.""","""<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the user has provided a text that seems to be part of a database schema for a notification system, along with some UML diagrams and privacy stories. My task is to annotate this text with specific metadata related to privacy behaviors and stories. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of the required categories entails. The categories are Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories. The Actions can be Collect, Use, or Share. Data Types have a detailed list, including things like Contact Data, Health Data, Financial Data, etc. Purposes include Contact, Analytics, Customization, Advertisement, Security, Tracking, Functionality, Accounts, and Requirements. Stories should be concise, explaining how these elements interact.\n\nLooking at the provided text, it's mainly about the database tables notify_subscription and notify_watch. These tables store information related to subscriptions and watches in a notification system. I can see that the notify_subscription table has columns like sid (session ID), authenticated, distributor, format, priority, and adverb. The notify_watch table has sid, authenticated, class, realm, target.\n\nSo, the first thing I notice is that the system is handling session IDs, which falls under Data Types as User ID and Session ID. Since the tables don't store email addresses but mention that subscription tuples might include an addr (email), that's another Data Type to consider.\n\nNow, thinking about the Actions: The system is Collecting data when it stores subscriptions and watches. It's Using this data to manage notifications, determine distribution methods, and prioritize them.\n\nFor Purposes, the primary ones seem to be Functionality, as the system needs to manage subscriptions and notifications effectively. There's also a mention of Authentication since it distinguishes between authenticated and anonymous sessions.\n\nPutting this together, the Stories should reflect how the system collects and uses session and contact data to manage notifications and authenticate users.\n\nI also need to ensure that I'm using the correct categories from the provided lists and not introducing any new ones. For example, under Data Types, I should stick to the subcategories like Contact Data (Email address), Usage Data (Session ID), etc.\n\nI should also consider the UML diagrams provided. The Track and TrackPoint classes handle location data and sensor data, which fall under Health Data and Location. However, since the main text is about notifications, the focus is more on session management and subscriptions.\n\nWait, the UML seems to be from a different context, maybe a fitness tracking app, given the Track, TrackPoint, and health-related sensors. But the initial text is about notifications, so perhaps the UML is part of a larger system. For this task, I think focusing on the notification system text is more relevant, but the UML adds context about other data types like location and health data, which might be collected elsewhere in the system.\n\nSo, considering both parts, the system might Collect location data and health data for functionality, like tracking user activities, and use them for analytics or providing statistics. However, the main text provided is about notification subscriptions, so the primary data types there are Session ID and possibly Email address.\n\nIn summary, I'll structure the annotations by identifying the Actions (Collect, Use), Data Types (Session ID, Email address), Purposes (Functionality, Authentication), and craft Stories that tie these together, explaining how the system manages subscriptions and notifications using the collected data.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \nContact Data:  \n  Email address:  \nSession ID:  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \nFunctionality, Authentication  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \nWe collect session ID and email address for functionality. We use session ID and email address for authentication.  \n</Stories>  \n<R>  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe text describes a notification system that stores subscription and watch data in tables. The `notify_subscription` table includes a `sid` (session ID) and an `authenticated` field, indicating the collection and use of session data for authentication. The system also references an `addr` field, which may contain an email address, collected for functionality purposes. The stories describe how session ID and email address are used for system functionality and user authentication."""

Getting Started
Choosing an Instance
If you are used to sites like Reddit, then Lemmy works in a fundamentally different way. Instead of a single website like reddit.com, there are many different websites (called instances). These are operated by different people, have different topics and rules. Nevertheless, posts created in one instance can directly be seen by users who are registered on another. Its basically like email, but for social media.

This means before using Lemmy and registering an account, you need to pick an instance. For this you can browse the instance list and look for one that matches your topics of interest. You can also see if the rules match your expectations, and how many users there are. It is better to avoid very big or very small instances. But don't worry too much about this choice, you can always create another account on a different instance later.

[instance list screenshot]

Registration
Once you choose an instance, it's time to create your account. To do this, click sign up in the top right of the page, or click the top right button on mobile to open a menu with sign up link.

[registration page screenshot]

On the signup page you need to enter a few things:

Username: How do you want to be called? This name can not be changed and is unique within an instance. Later you can also set a displayname which can be freely changed. If your desired username is taken, consider choosing a different instance where it is still available.
Email: Your email address. This is used for password resets and notifications (if enabled). Providing an email address is usually optional, but admins may choose to make it mandatory. In this case you will have to wait for a confirmation mail and click the link after completing this form.
Password: The password for logging in to your account. Make sure to choose a long and unique password which isn't used on any other website.
Verify password: Repeat the same password from above to ensure that it was entered correctly.
There are also a few optional fields, which you may need to fill in depending on the instance configuration:

Question/Answer: Instance admins can set an arbitrary question which needs to be answered in order to create an account. This is often used to prevent spam bots from signing up. After submitting the form, you will need to wait for some time until the answer is approved manually before you can login.
Code: A captcha which is easy to solve for humans but hard for bots. Enter the letters and numbers that you see in the text box, ignoring uppercase or lowercase. Click the refresh button if you are unable to read a character. The play button plays an audio version of the captcha.
Show NSFW content: Here you can choose if content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only) should be shown.
When you are done, press the sign up button.

It depends on the instance configuration when you can login and start using the account. In case the email is mandatory, you need to wait for the confirmation email and click the link first. In case ""Question/Answer"" is present, you need to wait for an admin to manually review and approve your registration. If you have problems with the registration, try to get in contact with the admin for support. You can also choose a different instance to sign up if your primary choice does not work.

Following Communities
After logging in to your new account, its time to follow communities that you are interested in. For this you can click on the communities link at the top of the page (on mobile, you need to click the menu icon on the top right first). You will see a list of communities which can be filtered by subscribed, local or all. Local communities are those which are hosted on the same site where you are signed in, while all also contains federated communities from other instances. In any case you can directly subscribe to communities with the right-hand subscribe link. Or click on the community name to browse the community first, see what its posted and what the rules are before subscribing.

Another way to find communities to subscribe to is by going to the front page and browsing the posts. If there is something that interests you, click on the post title to see more details and comments. Here you can subscribe to the community in the right-hand sidebar, or by clicking the ""sidebar"" button on mobile.

These previous ways will only show communities that are already known to the instance. Especially if you joined a small or inactive Lemmy instance, there will be few communities to discover. You can find more communities by browsing different Lemmy instances, or using the Lemmy Explorer. When you found a community that you want to follow, enter its URL (e.g. https://feddit.org/c/main) or the identifier (e.g. !main@feddit.org) into the search field of your own Lemmy instance. Lemmy will then fetch the community from its original instance, and allow you to interact with it. The same method also works to fetch users, posts or comments from other instances.

Setting up Your Profile
Before you start posting, its a good idea to provide some details about yourself. Open the top-right menu and go to ""settings"". Here the following settings are available for your public profile:

Displayname: An alternative username which can be changed at any time
Bio: Long description of yourself, can be formatted with Markdown
Matrix User: Your username on the decentralized Matrix chat
Avatar: Profile picture that is shown next to all your posts
Banner: A header image for your profile page
On this page you can also change the email and password. Additionally there are many other settings available, which allow customizing of your browsing experience:

Blocks (tab at top of the page): Here you can block users and communities, so that their posts will be hidden.
Interface language: Which language the user interface should use.
Languages: Select the languages that you speak to see only content in these languages. This is a new feature and many posts don't specify a language yet, so be sure to select ""Undetermined"" to see them.
Theme: You can choose between different color themes for the user interface. Instance admins can add more themes.
Type: Which timeline you want to see by default on the front page; only posts from communities that you subscribe to, posts in local communities, or all posts including federated.
Sort type: How posts and comments should be sorted by default. See Votes and Ranking for details.
Show NSFW content: Whether or not you want to see content that is ""not safe for work"" (or adult-only).
Show Scores: Whether the number of upvotes and downvotes should be visible.
Show Avatars: Whether profile pictures of other users should be shown.
Bot Account: Enable this if you are using a script or program to create posts automatically
Show Bot Accounts: Disable this to hide posts that were created by bot accounts.
Show Read Posts: If this is disabled, posts that you already viewed are not shown in listings anymore. Useful if you want to find new content easily, but makes it difficult to follow ongoing discussion under existing posts.
Show Notifications for New Posts: Enable this to receive a popup notification for each new post that is created.
Send notifications to Email: Enable to receive notifications about new comment replies and private messages to your email address.
Start Posting
Finally its time to start posting! To do this it is always a good idea to read the community rules in the sidebar (below the Subscribe button). When you are ready, go to a post and type your comment in the box directly below for a top-level reply. You can also write a nested reply to an existing comment, by clicking the left-pointing arrow.

Other than commenting on existing posts, you can also create new posts. To do this, click the button Create a post in the sidebar. Here you can optionally supply an external link or upload an image. The title field is mandatory and should describe what you are posting. The body is again optional, and gives space for long texts. You can also embed additional images here. The Community dropdown below allows choosing a different community to post in. With NSFW, posts can be marked as ""not safe for work"". Finally you can specify the language that the post is written in, and then click on Create.

One more possibility is to write private messages to individual users. To do this, simply visit a user profile and click Send message. You will be notified about new private messages and comment replies with the bell icon in the top right.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them: 
Privacy stories are built explicitly from our labelled privacy behaviors in the format of we (action) (data type) for (purpose)<Actions> Collect, Use </Actions> <Data Types> Email address, account information </Data Types> <Purposes> Account management, Functionality, authenticate </Purposes>1. We collect Email Addres and account information  For account management. We use Email address and account information for authenticate.

Registrations
You can enable registrations of on your instance. To prevent SPAM, we recommend to enable to following signup settings:

Require email verification
Require approval
Registration approval PeerTube >= 5.1
If signup require approval, users will request registration on your instance and will have to fill a Registration reason to help you to decide if you want to accept or not the user.

Registration reason input

Administrators and moderators can then list registration requests on the instance.

Registration list table

And accept or reject them. A Moderation response must be filled that will be sent to the user to explain its registration request has been accepted/rejected.

Accepting a registration will automatically create the user.

Registration accept modal

Manage users
The user menu allows you to manage all existing users on your instance.

Window displayed when in user menu

Users will be created when they register to your instance, but you may also create users manually using the ""create user"" button at the top right of the user menu.

Under the user menu you can update or delete a user by clicking on the three dots  at the left of a user info.

User dot button

Edit user will allow you to update user informations - see below.
Delete user will allow you to definitely delete this user. All of that user's videos will also be deleted.
Ban will disable connection for this user but videos and comments will be kept as is. No one else will be able to register with the same nickname or email address.
Editing users
When clicking on Edit, you can update parameters for a user such as email, role, video quota and so on. You also can specify if it needs review before a video goes public.

Window displayed when clicking on Edit user

You have two ways to reset password:

by sending a reset link to the user email
by changing it manually

Quotas
Video Quota
Video Quota represents the size limit a user cannot exceed when uploading videos. Each time a user upload a video, Peertube checks if there is enough quota to store it. If not, the upload is denied. Beware, the quota after an upload is estimated only on the size of the file uploaded. However, after transcoding (which outputs videos of unpredictable size) the video resolutions resulting of the transcoding are also taken into account in a user's quota. If you have enabled multiple resolutions, a user can use more than their quota on disk. Peertube will provide you an estimation of maximal space a user will use according to your transcoding options. You can change the default for new users in the configuration menu.

Daily Video Quota
Daily Video Quota represents the max quota a user is allowed to upload by day. You can tune this parameter to adjust the resources your instance will use. For instance, if you have many users transcoding could take a long time, so limiting upload by user by day could help to share resources between them. You can change the default for new users in the configuration menu.

Once you are satisfied with your user, you can click on the ""Update User"" button to save modifications.

Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand what's going on.\n\nFirst, the text explains how Lemmy works, which is a federated social media platform. Users have to choose an instance to register on, and each instance can have different rules and communities. The registration process involves creating a username, providing an email, setting a password, and sometimes answering a question or completing a CAPTCHA. There are also optional fields like showing NSFW content.\n\nThen, after logging in, users can follow communities, either through the instance's list or by exploring other instances. They can also set up their profile with a display name, bio, avatar, etc. Posting is done by creating a post, adding a title, optional link or image, and selecting a community. There's also the option to send private messages.\n\nMoving on to the admin side, there's a section about managing users, which includes enabling registrations, requiring email verification, and approving users. Admins can also edit user information, reset passwords, assign roles (admin, moderator, user), and manage quotas for video uploads.\n\nNow, looking at the categories I need to use: Actions are Collect, Use, Share. Data Types include various subcategories like Contact Data (Email, Username), Account Information, etc. Purposes include things like Authentication, Functionality, Security. Stories are concise scenarios combining these elements.\n\nStarting with Actions. The text mentions collecting email addresses and usernames during registration. So that's a Collect action. Then, using these for authentication, which is a Use action. Also, when admins manage user roles or edit information, that's another Use action. So I think I have two Use actions here.\n\nFor Data Types, the main ones are Email address and Username, both under Contact Data. There's also Account Information involved in managing user roles and details. So those are the Data Types.\n\nPurposes would be Authentication, since emails and usernames are used to log in. Functionality is also a purpose because the system needs to manage user accounts. Security comes into play when admins manage users and set roles to protect the platform.\n\nStories should tie these together. So, we collect email and username for account creation. Then use them for authentication and managing the system.\n\nI think that's the main points. Now, I'll structure this into the required XML format with the appropriate tags and rationale.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \n  Collect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n\n<Data Types>  \n  Contact Data:  \n    Email address:  \n    Username:  \n  Account Information:  \n    Username:  \n    Password:  \n    Email address:  \n</Data Types>  \n\n<Purposes>  \n  Authentication, Functionality, Security  \n</Purposes>  \n\n<Stories>  \n1.

During registration, users provide an email address and create a username, which are collected for account creation. These data types are used for authentication purposes, such as logging in and resetting passwords. Additionally, administrators use this information for platform functionality, such as managing user roles and security measures like approving registrations or banning users. The stories highlight how these actions and data types interact to facilitate user authentication, platform functionality, and security.  \n</R>""","""<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to annotate this text correctly based on the guidelines provided. The text is about setting up and managing a Lemmy instance, including user registration, account management, and various administrative tasks. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the actions mentioned. The text talks about collecting user data during registration, such as usernames, email addresses, and passwords. It also mentions using this data for account management, authentication, and functionality. Additionally, there are processes for managing users, like updating their information, banning, and resetting passwords. So the actions are Collect, Use, and Manage.\n\nNext, for data types, the text references Email address, Username, Password, and other Account Information like user roles and quotas. These all fall under the specified categories.\n\nLooking at purposes, the text discusses Account management, Authentication, Functionality, Security, and Moderation. These are all listed in the provided purposes.\n\nNow, for the stories, I need to create concise narratives that tie actions, data types, and purposes together. The first story would be about collecting email and account info for account management. The second is using email and account info for authentication. The third is using the same data for functionality. The fourth involves managing user data for security, and the fifth is using user data for moderation purposes.\n\nI think I covered all the necessary parts, but I need to make sure I'm using the correct categories and not missing any important points.

Manage Users & Auth
Registrations
You can enable registrations of on your instance. To prevent SPAM, we recommend to enable to following signup settings:

Require email verification
Require approval
Registration approval PeerTube >= 5.1
If signup require approval, users will request registration on your instance and will have to fill a Registration reason to help you to decide if you want to accept or not the user.

Registration reason input

Administrators and moderators can then list registration requests on the instance.

Registration list table

And accept or reject them. A Moderation response must be filled that will be sent to the user to explain its registration request has been accepted/rejected.

Accepting a registration will automatically create the user.

Registration accept modal

Manage users
The user menu allows you to manage all existing users on your instance.

Window displayed when in user menu

Users will be created when they register to your instance, but you may also create users manually using the ""create user"" button at the top right of the user menu.

Under the user menu you can update or delete a user by clicking on the three dots  at the left of a user info.

User dot button

Edit user will allow you to update user informations - see below.
Delete user will allow you to definitely delete this user. All of that user's videos will also be deleted.
Ban will disable connection for this user but videos and comments will be kept as is. No one else will be able to register with the same nickname or email address.
Editing users
When clicking on Edit, you can update parameters for a user such as email, role, video quota and so on. You also can specify if it needs review before a video goes public.

Window displayed when clicking on Edit user

You have two ways to reset password:

by sending a reset link to the user email
by changing it manually
Roles
Role defines what a user is allowed to do on the instance. There are three roles on PeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User.

Administrator
Administrators can do anything, and have access to the full admin backend.

Moderators can also do anything that a User account can do.

User
User is the default role.

Create, Edit, and Delete channels associated with their account
Create, Edit, and Delete playlists associated with their account
Upload, Edit, and Delete videos to their account, associated with one of their channels
Comment on videos
Add videos to playlists, or remove videos from them
Change user settings (See the Use PeerTube page for more information)
Report videos to the moderators with a comment about why the video is being reported
Quotas
Video Quota
Video Quota represents the size limit a user cannot exceed when uploading videos. Each time a user upload a video, Peertube checks if there is enough quota to store it. If not, the upload is denied. Beware, the quota after an upload is estimated only on the size of the file uploaded. However, after transcoding (which outputs videos of unpredictable size) the video resolutions resulting of the transcoding are also taken into account in a user's quota. If you have enabled multiple resolutions, a user can use more than their quota on disk. Peertube will provide you an estimation of maximal space a user will use according to your transcoding options. You can change the default for new users in the configuration menu.

Daily Video Quota
Daily Video Quota represents the max quota a user is allowed to upload by day. You can tune this parameter to adjust the resources your instance will use. For instance, if you have many users transcoding could take a long time, so limiting upload by user by day could help to share resources between them. You can change the default for new users in the configuration menu.

Once you are satisfied with your user, you can click on the ""Update User"" button to save modifications.

window.ST.analytics.logEvent(category, action, opt_label, props)
Current events:

""admin"", ""export"", ""users""
""listing"", ""commented""
""listing"", ""created""
""message"", ""sent""
""user"", ""signed up"", ""facebook""
""user"", ""signed up"", ""normal form""
In controllers:

  record_event(flash, event_category, event_data)

Sending events to different engines
All analytics events are triggered as custom jQuery ""st-analytics:"" events.

st-analytics:setup
Event is triggered on initialization, with user and community info, to send proper identification data to analytics engine:

  window.ST.analytics.data = {
      community_ident: """",
      community_uuid:  ""b1b3b8e4-41e6-11e7-b73b-204747729953"",
      community_id:    ""1"",
    
      user_id:      ""eIyDCQJZ-StdbCqLMC1qEA"",
      user_uuid:    ""b233c084-41e6-11e7-b73b-204747729953"",
      user_is_admin: true,
      user_email:    ""admin@example.com"",
      user_name:     ""Admin D"",
      user_hash:     null,
    
      feature_flags: [""topbar_v1""],
    
      plan_status:       ""active"",
      plan_member_limit:  null,
      plan_created_at:    1497439731,
      plan_updated_at:    1497439731,
      plan_expires_at:    null,
      plan_features:      ""deletable, admin_email, whitelabel"",
    
      identity_information: {
        ""info_user_id_old"":""eIyDCQJZ-StdbCqLMC1qEA"",
        ""info_marketplace_id"":""b1b3b8e4-41e6-11e7-b73b-204747729953"",
        ""info_marketplace_id_old"":1,""
        info_marketplace_url"":""http://tribeme.lvh.me:3000"",
        ""info_email_confirmed"":true
      }
    };

Sample handler for GTM:

  $(document).on(""st-analytics:setup"", function(event, info) {
    if (info.community_id) {
      dataLayer.push({""event"": ""identify"", ""id"": ""mp-""+info.community_id+""-admin"" });
    }

    dataLayer.push({ event: 'feature flags', featureFlags: info.feature_flags});
  });
st-analytics:logout
Event is triggered on user logout, for example to clear user session if tracked.

  $(document).on(""st-analytics:logout"", function(event, args){
    ampClient.setUserId(null);
    ampClient.regenerateDeviceid();
  });
st-analytics:event
Triggered for new analytics event.

window.ST.analytics.logEvent = function(category, action, opt_label, props) {
  $(document).trigger('st-analytics:event', {category: category, action: action, opt_label: opt_label, props: props});
}
Sample handle for Google Analytics:

  $(document).on('st-analytics:event', function(event, args) {
    var params_array = [args.category, args.action, args.opt_label];
    if (typeof _gaq !== 'undefined' && Array.isArray(_gaq)) {
      _gaq.push(['_trackEvent'].concat(params_array));
    }
  });

I need to identify actions, data types, purposes, and create stories based on that. Let me start by reading through the text carefully.\n\nFirst, under \""Manage Users & Auth,\"" the system can enable registrations with options like email verification and approval. Administrators can list and manage registration requests, accept or reject them, and send responses. They can also edit user info like email and role, reset passwords, ban users, and manage quotas. So, actions here are Collect (when gathering registration info), Use (when processing the data to accept/reject), and Share (when sending responses or when admins access user data).\n\nData types involved include Contact Data like Email address and User ID. There's also Account Information such as User ID, Username, and Password. Since they manage roles and quotas, maybe some Employment data under Biographical, but not sure. The purposes would be for Account Management, Security (verifying users), and Functionality (managing user roles and quotas).\n\nFor analytics, the system logs events like user sign-ups, transactions, and other actions. These events are sent to analytics engines, which involves Collecting data like User ID, Email, and Usage Data (e.g., pages visited). The purposes here are Analytics and possibly Customization to improve user experience.\n\nIn the stories, I need to connect how actions, data, and purposes interact. For example, collecting email for account management and using it for security. Also, using analytics data to understand user behavior for product improvement.\n\nI should make sure to use only the provided categories and structure each part correctly with XML tags. Let me organize this step by step to cover all sections without missing any key points.\n</think>\n\n```xml\n<Actions>\n    <Action>Collect</Action>\n    <Action>Use</Action>\n    <Action>Share</Action>\n</Actions>\n\n<Data Types>\n    <Data Type>Account Information</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Contact Data</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Usage Data</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Email address</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>User ID</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Username</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Password</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Role</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Video Quota</Data Type>\n</Data Types>\n\n<Purposes>\n    <Purpose>Account Management</Purpose>\n    <Purpose>Security</Purpose>\n    <Purpose>Functionality</Purpose>\n    <Purpose>Analytics</Purpose>\n</Purposes>\n\n<Stories>\n    <Story>We collect Email address, User ID, Username, and Password for Account Management.

Actions include collecting user data during registration and usage, using this data for security and functionality, and sharing it for operational needs. Data types cover contact and account information. Purposes relate to managing accounts securely and analyzing user behavior.\n</R>\n```""","""<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this user who is a privacy expert annotator. They need me to annotate a text file with specific metadata about privacy behaviors and stories. The text provided is about managing users and authentication on a platform, along with some analytics events.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the <Actions> section. The text talks about enabling registrations, which involves collecting user data like email addresses.

# Password auth provider callbacks

Password auth providers offer a way for server administrators to integrate
their Synapse installation with an external authentication system. The callbacks can be
registered by using the Module API's `register_password_auth_provider_callbacks` method.

## Callbacks

### `auth_checkers`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
auth_checkers: Dict[Tuple[str, Tuple[str, ...]], Callable]
```

A dict mapping from tuples of a login type identifier (such as `m.login.password`) and a
tuple of field names (such as `(""password"", ""secret_thing"")`) to authentication checking
callbacks, which should be of the following form:

```python
async def check_auth(
    user: str,
    login_type: str,
    login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

The login type and field names should be provided by the user in the
request to the `/login` API. [The Matrix specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#authentication-types)
defines some types, however user defined ones are also allowed.

The callback is passed the `user` field provided by the client (which might not be in
`@username:server` form), the login type, and a dictionary of login secrets passed by
the client.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the
`/login` request. If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return `None`
instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

Note that the user is not automatically registered, the `register_user(..)` method of
the [module API](writing_a_module.html) can be used to lazily create users.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type but with different
fields, Synapse will refuse to start.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type with the same fields,
then the callbacks will be executed in order, until one returns a Matrix User ID (and
optionally a callback). In that case, the return value of that callback will be accepted
and subsequent callbacks will not be fired. If every callback returns `None`, then the
authentication fails.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password, email ) (p: Log in)
### `check_3pid_auth`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def check_3pid_auth(
    medium: str, 
    address: str,
    password: str,
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

Called when a user attempts to register or log in with a third party identifier,
such as email. It is passed the medium (eg. `email`), an address (eg. `jdoe@example.com`)
and the user's password.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the `/login` request.
If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return None instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the authentication is denied.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password ) (p: Log out)
### `on_logged_out`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def on_logged_out(
    user_id: str,
    device_id: Optional[str],
    access_token: str
) -> None
``` 
Called during a logout request for a user. It is passed the qualified user ID, the ID of the
deactivated device (if any: access tokens are occasionally created without an associated
device ID), and the (now deactivated) access token.

Deleting the related pushers is done after calling `on_logged_out`, so you can rely on them
to still be present.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password, email ) (p: Account open)
### `get_username_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.52.0_

```python
async def get_username_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a username to set for the user
being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
username for this user. If a username is returned, it will be used as the local part of a
user's full Matrix ID (e.g. it's `alice` in `@alice:example.com`).

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration process.

The first dictionary contains the results of the [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
flow followed by the user. Its keys are the identifiers of every step involved in the flow,
associated with either a boolean value indicating whether the step was correctly completed,
or additional information (e.g. email address, phone number...). A list of most existing
identifiers can be found in the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#authentication-types).
Here's an example featuring all currently supported keys:

```python
{
    ""m.login.dummy"": True,  # Dummy authentication
    ""m.login.terms"": True,  # User has accepted the terms of service for the homeserver
    ""m.login.recaptcha"": True,  # User has completed the recaptcha challenge
    ""m.login.email.identity"": {  # User has provided and verified an email address
        ""medium"": ""email"",
        ""address"": ""alice@example.com"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.msisdn"": {  # User has provided and verified a phone number
        ""medium"": ""msisdn"",
        ""address"": ""33123456789"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.registration_token"": ""sometoken"",  # User has registered through a registration token
}
```

The second dictionary contains the parameters provided by the user's client in the request
to `/_matrix/client/v3/register`. See the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3register)
for a complete list of these parameters.

If the module cannot, or does not wish to, generate a username for this user, it must
return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username provided by the user is used, if any (otherwise one is automatically
generated).

### `get_displayname_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.54.0_

```python
async def get_displayname_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a display name to set for the
user being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
display name for this user.

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration use. These dictionaries are identical to the ones passed to
[`get_username_for_registration`](#get_username_for_registration), so refer to the
documentation of this callback for more information about them.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username will be used (e.g. `alice` if the user being registered is `@alice:example.com`).
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Phone number, email, username, password ) (p: Log in)
## `is_3pid_allowed`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.53.0_

```python
async def is_3pid_allowed(self, medium: str, address: str, registration: bool) -> bool
```

Called when attempting to bind a third-party identifier (i.e. an email address or a phone
number). The module is given the medium of the third-party identifier (which is `email` if
the identifier is an email address, or `msisdn` if the identifier is a phone number) and
its address, as well as a boolean indicating whether the attempt to bind is happening as
part of registering a new user. The module must return a boolean indicating whether the
identifier can be allowed to be bound to an account on the local homeserver.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `True`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `True` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback.

## Example

The example module below implements authentication checkers for two different login types: 
-  `my.login.type` 
    - Expects a `my_field` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_my_login`
- `m.login.password` (defined in [the spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#password-based))
    - Expects a `password` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_pass`

```python
from typing import Awaitable, Callable, Optional, Tuple

import synapse
from synapse import module_api


class MyAuthProvider:
    def __init__(self, config: dict, api: module_api):

        self.api = api

        self.credentials = {
            ""bob"": ""building"",
            ""@scoop:matrix.org"": ""digging"",
        }

        api.register_password_auth_provider_callbacks(
            auth_checkers={
                (""my.login_type"", (""my_field"",)): self.check_my_login,
                (""m.login.password"", (""password"",)): self.check_pass,
            },
        )

    async def check_my_login(
        self,
        username: str,
        login_type: str,
        login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
    ) -> Optional[
        Tuple[
            str,
            Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]],
        ]
    ]:
        if login_type != ""my.login_type"":
            return None

        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(""my_field""):
            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)

    async def check_pass(
        self,
        username: str,
        login_type: str,
        login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
    ) -> Optional[
        Tuple[
            str,
            Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]],
        ]
    ]:
        if login_type != ""m.login.password"":
            return None

        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(""password""):
            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)
```

# Account data callbacks

Account data callbacks allow module developers to react to changes of the account data
of local users. Account data callbacks can be registered using the module API's
`register_account_data_callbacks` method.

## Callbacks

The available account data callbacks are:

### `on_account_data_updated`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.57.0_

```python
async def on_account_data_updated(
    user_id: str,
    room_id: Optional[str],
    account_data_type: str,
    content: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
) -> None:
```

Called after user's account data has been updated. The module is given the
Matrix ID of the user whose account data is changing, the room ID the data is associated
with, the type associated with the change, as well as the new content. If the account
data is not associated with a specific room, then the room ID is `None`.

This callback is triggered when new account data is added or when the data associated with
a given type (and optionally room) changes. This includes deletion, since in Matrix,
deleting account data consists of replacing the data associated with a given type
(and optionally room) with an empty dictionary (`{}`).

Note that this doesn't trigger when changing the tags associated with a room, as these are
processed separately by Synapse.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.

## Example

The example below is a module that implements the `on_account_data_updated` callback, and
sends an event to an audit room when a user changes their account data.

```python
import json
import attr
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional

from synapse.module_api import JsonDict, ModuleApi
from synapse.module_api.errors import ConfigError


@attr.s(auto_attribs=True)
class CustomAccountDataConfig:

    sender: str


class CustomAccountDataModule:
    def __init__(self, config: CustomAccountDataConfig, api: ModuleApi):
        self.api = api
        self.config = config

        self.api.register_account_data_callbacks(
            on_account_data_updated=self.log_new_account_data,
        )

    @staticmethod
    def parse_config(config: Dict[str, Any]) -> CustomAccountDataConfig:
        def check_in_config(param: str):
            if param not in config:
                raise ConfigError(f""'{param}' is required"")

        check_in_config(""audit_room"")
        check_in_config(""sender"")

        return CustomAccountDataConfig(
            audit_room=config[""audit_room""],
            sender=config[""sender""],
        )

    async def log_new_account_data(
        self,
        user_id: str,
        room_id: Optional[str],
        account_data_type: str,
        content: JsonDict,
    ) -> None:
        content_raw = json.dumps(content)
        msg_content = f""{user_id} has changed their account data for type {account_data_type} to: {content_raw}""

        if room_id is not None:
            msg_content += f"" (in room {room_id})""

        await self.api.create_and_send_event_into_room(
            {
                ""room_id"": self.config.audit_room,
                ""sender"": self.config.sender,
                ""type"": ""m.room.message"",
                ""content"": {
                    ""msgtype"": ""m.text"",
                    ""body"": msg_content
                }
            }
        )

This function is triggered when a user's account data changes. It logs these changes and sends an audit event.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the actions. The module collects the user's account data when it's updated. It also uses this data to create an audit log. So, the actions are Collect and Use.\n\nNext, the data types. The function deals with account data, which includes user IDs, room IDs, account data types, and content. These fall under Account Information, which is a data type listed in the categories.\n\nFor purposes, the module is using the data for functionality, as it's part of the system's operation to track changes, and for security, since auditing is a security measure.\n\nNow, the stories. These should describe how the actions, data, and purposes interact. So, the stories would be about collecting and using account information for functionality and security.\n\nI need to make sure I only use the provided categories and structure each section correctly with the appropriate tags. Also, I'll include a rationale section after each annotation, separated by the <R> tag, explaining why I chose each category.\n\nFinally, I'll format everything in XML as specified, ensuring each category is properly enclosed in its respective tags and that the stories are concise and accurately reflect the interactions described.\n</think>\n\n```xml\n<Actions>\n    <Action>Collect</Action>\n    <Action>Use</Action>\n</Actions>\n\n<Data Types>\n    <Data Type>Account Information</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>User ID</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Room ID</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Account Data Type</Data Type>\n    <Data Type>Content</Data Type>\n</Data Types>\n\n<Purposes>\n    <Purpose>Functionality</Purpose>\n    <Purpose>Security</Purpose>\n</Purposes>\n\n<Stories>\n    <Story>We collect account information for functionality.</Story>\n    <Story>We use account information for functionality.</Story>\n    <Story>We collect account information for security.</Story>\n    <Story>We use account information for security.</Story>\n</Stories>\n\n<R>\nThe annotations are based on the functionality described in the text.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the text. It's about password authentication providers and account data callbacks in a Matrix server setup. The user wants me to identify actions, data types, purposes, and create stories based on these.\n\nLooking at the first section, it's about `auth_checkers`. The code here is handling authentication by checking user credentials. So, the actions here are \""collect\"" and \""use\"" because the system is gathering user data and using it to authenticate. The data types involved are account information like usernames and passwords. The purpose is \""authentication\"" and possibly \""security\"" since it's about verifying users.\n\nNext, there's `check_3pid_auth`, which deals with third-party identifiers like email. Again, actions are \""collect\"" and \""use\"" as it's handling email and password data. The purpose here is still \""authentication\"" and maybe \""account management\"" since it's part of the login process.\n\nThe `on_logged_out` function is triggered during logout. It collects device IDs and access tokens. The action is \""collect\"" and the purpose is \""security\"" as it's handling logout events which are crucial for securing accounts.\n\nThen, `get_username_for_registration` and `get_displayname_for_registration` are about user registration. They collect data like email, phone numbers, and usernames. The purpose here is \""account management\"" as it's setting up user accounts.\n\nThe `is_3pid_allowed` function checks if a third-party ID can be bound to an account. It collects email and phone numbers, using them to validate and manage accounts.\n\nIn the account data callbacks section, `on_account_data_updated` is about tracking changes in user account data. The action is \""collect\"" and the purpose is \""account management\"" and \""auditing\"" since it logs changes.\n\nFor each of these, I need to create stories that connect the actions, data, and purposes. For example, collecting account info and using it for authentication, or using email for account management.\n\nI should make sure to only use the categories provided and structure each annotation properly with the correct tags and rationales. I also need to ensure that the stories are concise and accurately reflect the interactions described.\n\nI think I've covered all the sections.

# Password auth provider callbacks

Password auth providers offer a way for server administrators to integrate
their Synapse installation with an external authentication system. The callbacks can be
registered by using the Module API's `register_password_auth_provider_callbacks` method.

## Callbacks

### `auth_checkers`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
auth_checkers: Dict[Tuple[str, Tuple[str, ...]], Callable]
```

A dict mapping from tuples of a login type identifier (such as `m.login.password`) and a
tuple of field names (such as `(""password"", ""secret_thing"")`) to authentication checking
callbacks, which should be of the following form:

```python
async def check_auth(
    user: str,
    login_type: str,
    login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

The login type and field names should be provided by the user in the
request to the `/login` API. [The Matrix specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#authentication-types)
defines some types, however user defined ones are also allowed.

The callback is passed the `user` field provided by the client (which might not be in
`@username:server` form), the login type, and a dictionary of login secrets passed by
the client.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the
`/login` request. If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return `None`
instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

Note that the user is not automatically registered, the `register_user(..)` method of
the [module API](writing_a_module.html) can be used to lazily create users.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type but with different
fields, Synapse will refuse to start.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type with the same fields,
then the callbacks will be executed in order, until one returns a Matrix User ID (and
optionally a callback). In that case, the return value of that callback will be accepted
and subsequent callbacks will not be fired. If every callback returns `None`, then the
authentication fails.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password, email ) (p: Log in)
### `check_3pid_auth`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def check_3pid_auth(
    medium: str, 
    address: str,
    password: str,
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

Called when a user attempts to register or log in with a third party identifier,
such as email. It is passed the medium (eg. `email`), an address (eg. `jdoe@example.com`)
and the user's password.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the `/login` request.
If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return None instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the authentication is denied.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password ) (p: Log out)
### `on_logged_out`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def on_logged_out(
    user_id: str,
    device_id: Optional[str],
    access_token: str
) -> None
``` 
Called during a logout request for a user. It is passed the qualified user ID, the ID of the
deactivated device (if any: access tokens are occasionally created without an associated
device ID), and the (now deactivated) access token.

Deleting the related pushers is done after calling `on_logged_out`, so you can rely on them
to still be present.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password, email ) (p: Account open)
### `get_username_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.52.0_

```python
async def get_username_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a username to set for the user
being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
username for this user. If a username is returned, it will be used as the local part of a
user's full Matrix ID (e.g. it's `alice` in `@alice:example.com`).

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration process.

The first dictionary contains the results of the [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
flow followed by the user. Its keys are the identifiers of every step involved in the flow,
associated with either a boolean value indicating whether the step was correctly completed,
or additional information (e.g. email address, phone number...). A list of most existing
identifiers can be found in the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#authentication-types).
Here's an example featuring all currently supported keys:

```python
{
    ""m.login.dummy"": True,  # Dummy authentication
    ""m.login.terms"": True,  # User has accepted the terms of service for the homeserver
    ""m.login.recaptcha"": True,  # User has completed the recaptcha challenge
    ""m.login.email.identity"": {  # User has provided and verified an email address
        ""medium"": ""email"",
        ""address"": ""alice@example.com"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.msisdn"": {  # User has provided and verified a phone number
        ""medium"": ""msisdn"",
        ""address"": ""33123456789"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.registration_token"": ""sometoken"",  # User has registered through a registration token
}
```

The second dictionary contains the parameters provided by the user's client in the request
to `/_matrix/client/v3/register`. See the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3register)
for a complete list of these parameters.

If the module cannot, or does not wish to, generate a username for this user, it must
return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username provided by the user is used, if any (otherwise one is automatically
generated).

### `get_displayname_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.54.0_

```python
async def get_displayname_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a display name to set for the
user being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
display name for this user.

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration use. These dictionaries are identical to the ones passed to
[`get_username_for_registration`](#get_username_for_registration), so refer to the
documentation of this callback for more information about them.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username will be used (e.g. `alice` if the user being registered is `@alice:example.com`).
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Phone number, email, username, password ) (p: Log in)
## `is_3pid_allowed`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.53.0_

```python
async def is_3pid_allowed(self, medium: str, address: str, registration: bool) -> bool
```

Called when attempting to bind a third-party identifier (i.e. an email address or a phone
number). The module is given the medium of the third-party identifier (which is `email` if
the identifier is an email address, or `msisdn` if the identifier is a phone number) and
its address, as well as a boolean indicating whether the attempt to bind is happening as
part of registering a new user. The module must return a boolean indicating whether the
identifier can be allowed to be bound to an account on the local homeserver.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `True`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `True` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback.

## Example

The example module below implements authentication checkers for two different login types: 
-  `my.login.type` 
    - Expects a `my_field` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_my_login`
- `m.login.password` (defined in [the spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#password-based))
    - Expects a `password` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_pass`

```python
from typing import Awaitable, Callable, Optional, Tuple

import synapse
from synapse import module_api


class MyAuthProvider:
    def __init__(self, config: dict, api: module_api):

        self.api = api

        self.credentials = {
            ""bob"": ""building"",
            ""@scoop:matrix.org"": ""digging"",
        }

        api.register_password_auth_provider_callbacks(
            auth_checkers={
                (""my.login_type"", (""my_field"",)): self.check_my_login,
                (""m.login.password"", (""password"",)): self.check_pass,
            },
        )

    async def check_my_login(
        self,
        username: str,
        login_type: str,
        login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
    ) -> Optional[
        Tuple[
            str,
            Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]],
        ]
    ]:
        if login_type != ""my.login_type"":
            return None

        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(""my_field""):
            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)

    async def check_pass(
        self,
        username: str,
        login_type: str,
        login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
    ) -> Optional[
        Tuple[
            str,
            Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]],
        ]
    ]:
        if login_type != ""m.login.password"":
            return None

        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(""password""):
            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)
```

Account validity callbacks allow module developers to add extra steps to verify the
validity on an account, i.e. see if a user can be granted access to their account on the
Synapse instance. Account validity callbacks can be registered using the module API's
`register_account_validity_callbacks` method.

The available account validity callbacks are:

### `is_user_expired`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.39.0_

```python
async def is_user_expired(user: str) -> Optional[bool]
```

Called when processing any authenticated request (except for logout requests). The module
can return a `bool` to indicate whether the user has expired and should be locked out of
their account, or `None` if the module wasn't able to figure it out. The user is
represented by their Matrix user ID (e.g. `@alice:example.com`).

If the module returns `True`, the current request will be denied with the error code
`ORG_MATRIX_EXPIRED_ACCOUNT` and the HTTP status code 403. Note that this doesn't
invalidate the user's access token.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback.

### `on_user_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.39.0_

```python
async def on_user_registration(user: str) -> None
```

Called after successfully registering a user, in case the module needs to perform extra
operations to keep track of them. (e.g. add them to a database table). The user is
represented by their Matrix user ID.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.

### `on_user_login`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.98.0_

```python
async def on_user_login(user_id: str, auth_provider_type: str, auth_provider_id: str) -> None
```

Called after successfully login or registration of a user for cases when module needs to perform extra operations after auth.
represented by their Matrix user ID.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.

Let me start by understanding the content of the text.\n\nThe text describes several callbacks related to account validity in the Synapse module. These include `is_user_expired`, `on_user_registration`, and `on_user_login`. Each of these callbacks is triggered during different events in the user authentication process.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the actions. The callbacks involve checking if a user's account is expired, performing actions after registration, and handling login events. These seem to fall under the \""Use\"" action since they are processing existing data to make decisions or trigger other processes.\n\nNext, the data types. The callbacks reference the user's Matrix ID, which is part of Account Information. Additionally, `on_user_login` includes parameters like `auth_provider_type` and `auth_provider_id`, which relate to Authentication Data. There's no mention of other data types like Contact Data or Financial Data, so I'll stick to these.\n\nFor purposes, these callbacks are used to manage account access and security. `is_user_expired` checks if an account should be locked, which is about Security. `on_user_registration` and `on_user_login` are about managing user accounts and tracking access, so they relate to Account Management and Security as well.\n\nNow, creating stories. I'll frame them around collecting and using data for specific purposes. For example, using Account Information and Authentication Data for Security and Account Management.\n\nI need to ensure I'm using only the specified categories and avoiding any others. Also, each annotation should be concise and directly tied to the text content without adding external information.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the annotations with the appropriate tags and provide a clear rationale for each choice, making sure to separate them with the <R> tag as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Use</Actions> \n<Data Types>Account Information, Authentication Data</Data Types> \n<Purposes>Security, Account Management</Purposes> \n<Stories>1.

The key actions involve checking if a user's account is expired (`is_user_expired`), performing additional operations after a user registers (`on_user_registration`), and handling login events (`on_user_login`). These actions primarily involve using existing account information and authentication data to ensure security and proper account management. The purposes are tied to maintaining account security and managing user access, which aligns with the identified data types and actions.\n</R>""","""<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at the user's query. They want me to annotate a given text with specific metadata about privacy behaviors and stories. The text is about password authentication provider callbacks in Synapse, which is a Matrix server. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the text. It's divided into sections, each describing a different callback. Each callback has a Python function and an explanation. My task is to identify actions, data types, purposes, and create stories from them.\n\nThe user provided categories for actions, data types, and purposes. I need to stick to those. Let me go through each section one by one.\n\nStarting with the `auth_checkers` function. It's used for authentication. It collects user credentials like username, password, and possibly other fields. The purpose here is authentication and functionality. So, the actions are Collect and Use, data types include Account Information, Username, Password, and maybe Email. The purposes are Authentication and Functionality.\n\nNext, `check_3pid_auth` deals with third-party identifiers like email. It collects and uses email and password. The purpose is still Authentication and Functionality.\n\nMoving on to `on_logged_out`, this logs out a user. It uses their User ID, Device ID, and Access Token. The purpose here is more about Security, ensuring the session is terminated properly.\n\nThen, `get_username_for_registration` and `get_displayname_for_registration` are about user registration. They collect and use data like Email, Phone Number, Username, and Password. The purpose is Account Management and Functionality.\n\nThe `is_3pid_allowed` function checks if a third-party ID can be bound to an account. It uses Email and Phone Number. The purpose is Security and Functionality.\n\nLooking at the example provided, it uses credentials for authentication. So, Collect and Use actions, with data types like Username and Password for Authentication.\n\nThe second part of the text is about account validity callbacks. `is_user_expired` checks if a user's account is expired. It uses User ID for Security and Functionality. `on_user_registration` logs new users, using User ID for Account Management. `on_user_login` tracks logins, using User ID, Auth Provider Type, and ID for Security and Functionality.\n\nNow, I need to structure each annotation correctly. For each callback, I'll list the actions, data types, purposes, and create a story. Then, provide a rationale for each.\n\nI should make sure to only use the categories provided and format everything properly with XML tags. Also, I need to ensure each annotation is followed by the rationale, separated by the <R> tag.\n\nI think I've covered all the sections. Now, I'll structure each part step by step, ensuring each annotation is accurate and the rationale clearly explains why those choices were made.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Collect, Use</Actions>  \n<Data Types>Account Information, Username, Password, Email Address, Phone Number</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>Authentication, Functionality, Security, Account Management</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \nWe collect account information, username, password, email address, and phone number for authentication.

# Account validity callbacks

Account validity callbacks allow module developers to add extra steps to verify the
validity on an account, i.e. see if a user can be granted access to their account on the
Synapse instance. Account validity callbacks can be registered using the module API's
`register_account_validity_callbacks` method.

The available account validity callbacks are:

### `is_user_expired`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.39.0_

```python
async def is_user_expired(user: str) -> Optional[bool]
```

Called when processing any authenticated request (except for logout requests). The module
can return a `bool` to indicate whether the user has expired and should be locked out of
their account, or `None` if the module wasn't able to figure it out. The user is
represented by their Matrix user ID (e.g. `@alice:example.com`).

If the module returns `True`, the current request will be denied with the error code
`ORG_MATRIX_EXPIRED_ACCOUNT` and the HTTP status code 403. Note that this doesn't
invalidate the user's access token.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback.

### `on_user_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.39.0_

```python
async def on_user_registration(user: str) -> None
```

Called after successfully registering a user, in case the module needs to perform extra
operations to keep track of them. (e.g. add them to a database table). The user is
represented by their Matrix user ID.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.

### `on_user_login`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.98.0_

```python
async def on_user_login(user_id: str, auth_provider_type: str, auth_provider_id: str) -> None
```

Called after successfully login or registration of a user for cases when module needs to perform extra operations after auth.
represented by their Matrix user ID.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.

Here are the behaviors and the privacy requirements in the form of privacy stories we build from them: 
Privacy stories are built explicitly from our labelled privacy behaviors in the format of we (action) (data type) for (purpose)<Actions> use </Actions> <Data Types> account information </Data Types> <Purposes> Security,account management, functionality </Purposes>1. We use account information for security. We use account information for functionality. We use account information for account management.. </Stories># Password auth provider callbacks

Password auth providers offer a way for server administrators to integrate
their Synapse installation with an external authentication system. The callbacks can be
registered by using the Module API's `register_password_auth_provider_callbacks` method.

## Callbacks

### `auth_checkers`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
auth_checkers: Dict[Tuple[str, Tuple[str, ...]], Callable]
```

A dict mapping from tuples of a login type identifier (such as `m.login.password`) and a
tuple of field names (such as `(""password"", ""secret_thing"")`) to authentication checking
callbacks, which should be of the following form:

```python
async def check_auth(
    user: str,
    login_type: str,
    login_dict: ""synapse.module_api.JsonDict"",
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

The login type and field names should be provided by the user in the
request to the `/login` API. [The Matrix specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#authentication-types)
defines some types, however user defined ones are also allowed.

The callback is passed the `user` field provided by the client (which might not be in
`@username:server` form), the login type, and a dictionary of login secrets passed by
the client.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the
`/login` request. If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return `None`
instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

Note that the user is not automatically registered, the `register_user(..)` method of
the [module API](writing_a_module.html) can be used to lazily create users.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type but with different
fields, Synapse will refuse to start.

If multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type with the same fields,
then the callbacks will be executed in order, until one returns a Matrix User ID (and
optionally a callback). In that case, the return value of that callback will be accepted
and subsequent callbacks will not be fired. If every callback returns `None`, then the
authentication fails.


{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password, email ) (p: Log in)
### `check_3pid_auth`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def check_3pid_auth(
    medium: str, 
    address: str,
    password: str,
) -> Optional[
    Tuple[
        str, 
        Optional[Callable[[""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse""], Awaitable[None]]]
    ]
]
```

Called when a user attempts to register or log in with a third party identifier,
such as email. It is passed the medium (eg. `email`), an address (eg. `jdoe@example.com`)
and the user's password.

If the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. 
`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the `/login` request.
If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return None instead.

If the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the authentication is denied.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password ) (p: Log out)
### `on_logged_out`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.46.0_

```python
async def on_logged_out(
    user_id: str,
    device_id: Optional[str],
    access_token: str
) -> None
``` 
Called during a logout request for a user. It is passed the qualified user ID, the ID of the
deactivated device (if any: access tokens are occasionally created without an associated
device ID), and the (now deactivated) access token.

Deleting the related pushers is done after calling `on_logged_out`, so you can rely on them
to still be present.

If multiple modules implement this callback, Synapse runs them all in order.
\} 

{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Account data, Username, password, email ) (p: Account open)
### `get_username_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.52.0_

```python
async def get_username_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a username to set for the user
being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
username for this user. If a username is returned, it will be used as the local part of a
user's full Matrix ID (e.g. it's `alice` in `@alice:example.com`).

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration process.

The first dictionary contains the results of the [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
flow followed by the user. Its keys are the identifiers of every step involved in the flow,
associated with either a boolean value indicating whether the step was correctly completed,
or additional information (e.g. email address, phone number...). A list of most existing
identifiers can be found in the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.1/client-server-api/#authentication-types).
Here's an example featuring all currently supported keys:

```python
{
    ""m.login.dummy"": True,  # Dummy authentication
    ""m.login.terms"": True,  # User has accepted the terms of service for the homeserver
    ""m.login.recaptcha"": True,  # User has completed the recaptcha challenge
    ""m.login.email.identity"": {  # User has provided and verified an email address
        ""medium"": ""email"",
        ""address"": ""alice@example.com"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.msisdn"": {  # User has provided and verified a phone number
        ""medium"": ""msisdn"",
        ""address"": ""33123456789"",
        ""validated_at"": 1642701357084,
    },
    ""m.login.registration_token"": ""sometoken"",  # User has registered through a registration token
}
```

The second dictionary contains the parameters provided by the user's client in the request
to `/_matrix/client/v3/register`. See the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3register)
for a complete list of these parameters.

If the module cannot, or does not wish to, generate a username for this user, it must
return `None`.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username provided by the user is used, if any (otherwise one is automatically
generated).

### `get_displayname_for_registration`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.54.0_

```python
async def get_displayname_for_registration(
    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],
    params: Dict[str, Any],
) -> Optional[str]
```

Called when registering a new user. The module can return a display name to set for the
user being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a
display name for this user.

This callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)
has been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is
passed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during
the registration process. These dictionaries are identical to the ones passed to
[`get_username_for_registration`](#get_username_for_registration), so refer to the
documentation of this callback for more information about them.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,
the username will be used (e.g. `alice` if the user being registered is `@alice:example.com`).
\} 

## `is_3pid_allowed`

_First introduced in Synapse v1.53.0_

```python
async def is_3pid_allowed(self, medium: str, address: str, registration: bool) -> bool
```

Called when attempting to bind a third-party identifier (i.e. an email address or a phone
number). The module is given the medium of the third-party identifier (which is `email` if
the identifier is an email address, or `msisdn` if the identifier is a phone number) and
its address, as well as a boolean indicating whether the attempt to bind is happening as
part of registering a new user. The module must return a boolean indicating whether the
identifier can be allowed to be bound to an account on the local homeserver.

If multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a
callback returns `True`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first
callback that does not return `True` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call
any of the subsequent implementations of this callback.

## Example

The example module below implements authentication checkers for two different login types: 
-  `my.login.type` 
    - Expects a `my_field` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_my_login`
- `m.login.password` (defined in [the spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#password-based))
    - Expects a `password` field to be sent to `/login`
    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_pass`

```python

[The Matrix specification](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#authentication-types)\ndefines some types, however user defined ones are also allowed.\n\nThe callback is passed the `user` field provided by the client (which might not be in\n`@username:server` form), the login type, and a dictionary of login secrets passed by\nthe client.\n\nIf the authentication is successful, the module must return the user's Matrix ID (e.g. \n`@alice:example.com`) and optionally a callback to be called with the response to the\n`/login` request. If the module doesn't wish to return a callback, it must return `None`\ninstead.\n\nIf the authentication is unsuccessful, the module must return `None`.\n\nNote that the user is not automatically registered, the `register_user(..)` method of\nthe [module API](writing_a_module.html) can be used to lazily create users.\n\nIf multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type but with different\nfields, Synapse will refuse to start.\n\nIf multiple modules register an auth checker for the same login type with the same fields,\nthen the callbacks will be executed in order, until one returns a Matrix User ID (and\noptionally a callback). In that case, the return value of that callback will be accepted\nand subsequent callbacks will not be fired.

See the [Matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3register)\nfor a complete list of these parameters.\n\nIf the module cannot, or does not wish to, generate a username for this user, it must\nreturn `None`.\n\nIf multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a\ncallback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first\ncallback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call\nany of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,\nthe username provided by the user is used, if any (otherwise one is automatically\ngenerated).\n\n### `get_displayname_for_registration`\n\n_First introduced in Synapse v1.54.0_\n\n```python\nasync def get_displayname_for_registration(\n    uia_results: Dict[str, Any],\n    params: Dict[str, Any],\n) -> Optional[str]\n```\n\nCalled when registering a new user. The module can return a display name to set for the\nuser being registered by returning it as a string, or `None` if it doesn't wish to force a\ndisplay name for this user.\n\nThis callback is called once [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api)\nhas been completed by the user. It is not called when registering a user via SSO. It is\npassed two dictionaries, which include the information that the user has provided during\nthe registration use. These dictionaries are identical to the ones passed to\n[`get_username_for_registration`](#get_username_for_registration), so refer to the\ndocumentation of this callback for more information about them.\n\nIf multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a\ncallback returns `None`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first\ncallback that does not return `None` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call\nany of the subsequent implementations of this callback. If every callback returns `None`,\nthe username will be used (e.g. `alice` if the user being registered is `@alice:example.com`).\n\\} \n\n{#s (a: collect, use) (dt: Phone number, email, username, password ) (p: Log in)\n## `is_3pid_allowed`\n\n_First introduced in Synapse v1.53.0_\n\n```python\nasync def is_3pid_allowed(self, medium: str, address: str, registration: bool) -> bool\n```\n\nCalled when attempting to bind a third-party identifier (i.e. an email address or a phone\nnumber). The module is given the medium of the third-party identifier (which is `email` if\nthe identifier is an email address, or `msisdn` if the identifier is a phone number) and\nits address, as well as a boolean indicating whether the attempt to bind is happening as\npart of registering a new user. The module must return a boolean indicating whether the\nidentifier can be allowed to be bound to an account on the local homeserver.\n\nIf multiple modules implement this callback, they will be considered in order. If a\ncallback returns `True`, Synapse falls through to the next one. The value of the first\ncallback that does not return `True` will be used. If this happens, Synapse will not call\nany of the subsequent implementations of this callback.\n\n## Example\n\nThe example module below implements authentication checkers for two different login types: \n-  `my.login.type` \n    - Expects a `my_field` field to be sent to `/login`\n    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_my_login`\n- `m.login.password` (defined in [the spec](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest#password-based))\n    - Expects a `password` field to be sent to `/login`\n    - Is checked by the method: `self.check_pass`\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Awaitable, Callable, Optional, Tuple\n\nimport synapse\nfrom synapse import module_api\n\n\nclass MyAuthProvider:\n    def __init__(self, config: dict, api: module_api):\n\n        self.api = api\n\n        self.credentials = {\n            \""bob\"": \""building\"",\n            \""@scoop:matrix.org\"": \""digging\"",\n        }\n\n        api.register_password_auth_provider_callbacks(\n            auth_checkers={\n                (\""my.login_type\"", (\""my_field\"",)): self.check_my_login,\n                (\""m.login.password\"", (\""password\"",)): self.check_pass,\n            },\n        )\n\n    async def check_my_login(\n        self,\n        username: str,\n        login_type: str,\n        login_dict: \""synapse.module_api.JsonDict\"",\n    ) -> Optional[\n        Tuple[\n            str,\n            Optional[Callable[[\""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse\""], Awaitable[None]]],\n        ]\n    ]:\n        if login_type != \""my.login_type\"":\n            return None\n\n        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(\""my_field\""):\n            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)\n\n    async def check_pass(\n        self,\n        username: str,\n        login_type: str,\n        login_dict: \""synapse.module_api.JsonDict\"",\n    ) -> Optional[\n        Tuple[\n            str,\n            Optional[Callable[[\""synapse.module_api.LoginResponse\""], Awaitable[None]]],\n        ]\n    ]:\n        if login_type != \""m.login.password\"":\n            return None\n\n        if self.credentials.get(username) == login_dict.get(\""password\""):\n            return (self.api.get_qualified_user_id(username), None)\n```"", ""metadata"": {""actions"": [""Collect, use""], ""data_types"": [""account information, email address, phone number""], ""purposes"": [""functionality, account management""], ""stories"": [""We collect account information, email address and phone number for functionality.

The user has given me a detailed structure to follow, so I need to make sure I adhere to it. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the actions, data types, purposes, and stories from the provided text. The user has specified the categories for each, so I should only use those. Let's break down the text step by step.\n\nLooking at the text, it's about account validity callbacks and password auth provider callbacks in a module for Synapse. There are several functions defined here, like `is_user_expired`, `on_user_registration`, `on_user_login`, and others. Each of these functions seems to handle different aspects of user authentication and account management.\n\nStarting with actions, the main actions I notice are \""Use\"" and \""Collect\"". For example, the callbacks use user IDs, passwords, and other account information to verify authenticity or manage accounts. There's also \""Share\"" involved when modules pass user data between each other or to the server.\n\nNext, data types. The text frequently mentions user IDs, passwords, email addresses, and other identifiers. These fall under \""Account Information\"" and its subcategories like User ID, Password, and Email address. There's also mention of third-party identifiers, which could be emails or phone numbers, so those should be included as well.\n\nFor purposes, the primary ones seem to be Security, Functionality, and Account Management. The callbacks are checking if users are expired, handling logins, and managing registrations, all of which are about securing access and ensuring the system runs smoothly.\n\nNow, the stories. These should tie together the actions, data types, and purposes. For example, using account information for security purposes makes sense because the callbacks are verifying user credentials to grant access. Similarly, using account information for functionality would involve managing user sessions or registrations.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm using the correct XML tags as specified. Each category should be wrapped in its respective tag, and I should provide a rationale for each annotation. The user emphasized using only the provided categories, so I need to avoid any others.\n\nLet me go through each section of the text and extract the necessary information. For instance, the `is_user_expired` function uses the user ID to check if an account is expired, which relates to Security. The `on_user_login` function handles login events, which is about Functionality and Security as well.\n\nI should also consider how data is being handled across multiple modules. For example, if a module can't determine if a user is expired, it returns None, and the next module takes over. This indicates data being shared between modules, hence the \""Share\"" action.\n\nIn the password auth provider section, functions like `check_auth` and `check_3pid_auth` collect and use passwords and third-party IDs (like emails) for authentication, which is Security. The `on_logged_out` function uses access tokens and device IDs to handle logout, which is about Functionality and Security.\n\nFor the registration callbacks like `get_username_for_registration`, they use user-provided info to set up accounts, which falls under Account Management and Functionality.\n\nI need to ensure that each story is concise and directly ties the action, data type, and purpose together. For example, \""We use account information for security\"" covers how user IDs and passwords are used to authenticate and authorize access.\n\nI also need to make sure that my rationale clearly explains why each annotation was chosen, linking back to specific parts of the text. This will help anyone reviewing the annotations understand the reasoning behind them.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the annotations with the correct XML tags, ensuring each category is properly separated and the rationale is placed after each annotation block as specified.\n</think>\n\n```xml\n<Actions>\n  Collect, Use, Share\n</Actions>\n<Data Types>\n  Account Information:\n    User ID:\n    Password:\n    Email address:\n    Third-party identifiers (e.g., email, phone number):\n</Data Types>\n<Purposes>\n  Security, Functionality, Account Management\n</Purposes>\n<Stories>\n  We use account information for security. We use account information for functionality. We use account information for account management.\n</Stories>\n<R>\n  The annotations are based on the callbacks and their purposes in the text. The actions involve collecting and using account information to verify user access, manage accounts, and ensure security. The data types include user IDs, passwords, and third-party identifiers like email addresses. The purposes are primarily related to security, functionality, and account management. The stories capture how these elements interact to ensure secure and functional account handling.\n</R>\n```""","""<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to annotate this text properly. The user has provided a detailed document about account validity callbacks and password auth provider callbacks in a Synapse module. My task is to identify Actions, Data Types, Purposes, and Stories based on the given categories.\n\nFirst, I need to read through the text carefully to understand what each section is about. The document explains different callbacks that module developers can use to add functionality related to user authentication and account management.\n\nLooking at the first part about account validity callbacks, I see functions like `is_user_expired`, `on_user_registration`, and `on_user_login`. These functions handle checking if a user's account is expired, performing actions after registration, and actions after login. So the actions here are 'Use' because they are processing user data to determine access.\n\nThe data types involved are 'Account Information' since these callbacks deal with user IDs, registration status, and login details. There's no mention of other data types like health or financial data, so it's just account info.\n\nThe purposes of these actions are likely 'Security' because they're checking if a user should be locked out, and 'Functionality' because they're part of the system's operation. Also, 'Account Management' fits since they handle registration and login processes.\n\nFor the stories, I can say that the system uses account information to secure access by checking expiration and to manage accounts during registration and login.\n\nMoving on to the password auth provider callbacks, there are functions like `check_auth`, `check_3pid_auth`, `on_logged_out`, `get_username_for_registration`, and `get_displayname_for_registration`. These functions handle authentication, third-party logins, logout actions, and setting usernames and display names.\n\nThe actions here are 'Collect' and 'Use' because they gather user credentials and process them for authentication. The data types are 'Account Information' again, specifically 'Username' and 'Password' since those are the credentials being handled.\n\nThe purposes include 'Security' for authentication, 'Functionality' for processing logins and logouts, and 'Account Management' for setting up user accounts with usernames and display names.\n\nThe stories would involve using account information to secure authentication processes and manage user accounts through registration and login, ensuring the system functions correctly.\n\nI need to make sure I'm only using the categories provided and not introducing any new ones. Also, I should structure each annotation properly with the tags and provide a clear rationale for each part.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Now, I'll format the annotations and rationales as specified.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Use</Actions> \n<Data Types>Account Information</Data Types> \n<Purposes>Security, Functionality, Account Management</Purposes> \n<Stories>We use account information for security.

These callbacks use account information to determine if a user's account is expired, perform actions after registration, and handle login processes. The purposes are security, functionality, and account management.

Extension Point :
INotificationSubscriber
Interface
INotificationSubscriber
Since
1.1.3
Module
trac.notification
Source
api.py
â€‹
The
INotificationSubscriber
subscribes users to
notification
events.
Purpose
Trac provides an extendible and flexible notification system. Different people are interested in different kinds of notifications. Notification subscriptions allow administrators and / or users to configure the exact rules used that trigger sending of notifications.
Usage
Implementing the interface follows the standard guidelines found in
TracDev/ComponentArchitecture
and of course
TracDev/PluginDevelopment
.
The main part of this interface is the
match()
function. It returns a list of subscriptions, in the form of tuples consisting of:
class
: The name of the Python class. (This could probably be removed.)
distributor
: Also known as
transport
. E.g. the string
email
. See
INotificationDistributor
.
sid
: The session ID of the subscriber. (Can be
None
if
address
is provided.)
authenticated
:
1
for authenticated session IDs,
0
for anonymous session IDs.
address
: The (email) address to use. (Can be
None
if
sid
is provided.)
format
: The MIME type to be used (e.g.
text/plain
or
text/html
.)
priority
: An integer priority. Smaller numbers have higher priority than bigger numbers.
1
is the highest priority.
adverb
: Either the string
always
or
never
.
Since more than one component can handle the same realms and categories, the priorities and adverbs are used to resolve conflicting subscriptions.
The implementation can use any means to determine if a user is interested in hearing about a given event.
Most check that the appropriate conditions apply and then retrieve the required information from the
subscription
DB table.
The subscriptions in that table are configured in a shared preferences panel that uses two other methods of this interface:
The simple
description()
method returns a description string shown to the user in the preferences panel (or
None
if the plugin does use the
subscriptions
DB table.)
The
requires_authentication()
method allows hiding the rule from unauthenticated users. (E.g. because only authenticated users can be ticket owners.)
The
default_subscriptions()
method describes any  default subscriptions that automatically exist without the user configuring
subscription
DB entries in the preferences.
These are also displayed on the preferences panel, but can not be directly modified there. (They usually can be overriden by non-default subscriptions.)
The plugin still has to return the respective subscriptions from the
matches()
method.
Default descriptions should be used when users can be determined by the event itself.
For instance, ticket author has a default subscription that is controlled via trac.ini.
Default subscriptions should be low priority (i.e. have a priority number much larger than
1
, like 100) so that the user can easily override them.
Examples
The following example implements a simple subscriber that can trigger notifications when a new ticket is created with a high priority level.

Let me start by reading through it carefully.\n\nThe text is about the notification system in Trac, specifically the database schema related to notifications. It describes two tables: notify_subscription and notify_watch. Each has several columns that store information about subscriptions and watches.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the actions mentioned. The text talks about storing subscriptions and watches in the database. So, the actions are \""Store\"" for both tables, each with their respective data.\n\nNext, I'll look at the data types. The notify_subscription table has columns like sid (session ID), class (Python class name), distributor (like email), format (MIME type), priority, and adverb. These relate to User ID, Address (email), and Device Information (format as MIME type). The notify_watch table includes sid, class, realm, and target, which are User ID, Address, and maybe some Usage Data like realm and target.\n\nFor purposes, the primary goal here is functionality. The tables are set up to manage how notifications are handled, so it's all about making the system work as intended. There's no mention of analytics, ads, or customization, so I think functionality covers it.\n\nNow, the stories. The first story is about storing subscriptions with session IDs and email addresses for functionality. The second is about storing watches with session IDs and target information, also for functionality.\n\nI need to make sure I'm using the correct categories. Actions are Store, Data Types include User ID, Address, Device Information, Usage Data, and Purposes are Functionality. Each story connects the action, data, and purpose clearly.\n\nI should also check if there are any other purposes or data types I might have missed, but from the text, it seems these are the main points. The focus is on how the data is stored to enable notifications, so functionality makes sense as the primary purpose.\n</think>\n\n<Actions> Store, Store </Actions>  \n<Data Types> Session ID, Email address, Format, Priority, Adverb, Class, Realm, Target </Data Types>  \n<Purposes> Functionality, Functionality </Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n1. We store session ID, email address, format, priority, adverb for functionality.  \n2. We store class, realm, target for functionality.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \nThe text discusses the database schema for Trac's notification system, specifically the `notify_subscription` and `notify_watch` tables.  \n\n1. **Actions**: The actions are \""Store\"" because the text describes how subscription and watch data are stored in the database tables.  \n2. **Data Types**:  \n   - `Session ID` is stored in both tables to identify the subscriber.  \n   - `Email address` is implied by the `distributor` column, which can be \""email.\""  \n   - `Format` refers to the MIME type used for notifications.  \n   - `Priority` and `adverb` are stored in `notify_subscription` to manage notification precedence and behavior.  \n   - `Class`, `realm`, and `target` are stored in `notify_watch` to track the specific resources being watched.  \n3. **Purposes**: The purpose is \""Functionality\"" because the tables are used to manage and store notification subscriptions and watches, enabling the system to function correctly.  \n4. **Stories**:  \n   - The first story captures how subscriptions are stored with details like session ID, email, format, priority, and adverb to enable notification functionality.  \n   - The second story highlights how watches are stored with class, realm, and target to track resources for notifications.  \n</R>""","""<think>\nAlright, so I need to annotate this text about Trac's notification system. Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll look for actions mentioned. The text talks about storing subscriptions in the database, which implies data is being collected and used. So, the actions are Collect and Use.\n\nNext, data types. The notify_subscription table has columns like class, sid, authenticated, distributor, format, priority, adverb. Sid is a session ID, which falls under Device Information. Authenticated is more about the user's status, so maybe User ID under Contact Data. Distributor could be an email address, which is Contact Data. Format is MIME type, which doesn't fit any specific data type listed, so maybe it's not annotated. Priority and adverb are more about the system's handling, not specific data types.\n\nNow, purposes. The subscriptions are used for sending notifications, which is part of the system's functionality. They also allow customization based on user preferences, so that's another purpose. Security comes into play because they handle authenticated sessions, so that's a third purpose.\n\nFor the stories, I need to tie actions, data, and purposes together. So, collecting session IDs and using them for functionality, customization, and security makes sense. Also, collecting email addresses for the same reasons.\n\nI should make sure I'm using only the provided categories and not adding any new ones. That means sticking to the predefined actions, data types, purposes, and structuring the stories clearly.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>  \nCollect, Use  \n</Actions>  \n<Data Types>  \nSession ID, Email address  \n</Data Types>  \n<Purposes>  \nFunctionality, Customization, Security  \n</Purposes>  \n<Stories>  \n1. We collect session ID and email address for functionality. We use session ID and email address for customization and security.  \n</Stories>  \n\n<R>  \nThe text describes the database schema for Trac's notification system, which involves storing subscriptions and watches. The actions of \""collect\"" and \""use\"" are evident as the system gathers and processes data like session IDs and email addresses. The purposes of functionality, customization, and security are inferred from how the system manages notifications, allows user preferences, and handles authentication. The stories tie these elements together, showing how data collection and usage support the system's operations and user experience."""

Extension Point :
INotificationSubscriber
Interface
INotificationSubscriber
Since
1.1.3
Module
trac.notification
Source
api.py
â€‹
The
INotificationSubscriber
subscribes users to
notification
events.
Purpose
Trac provides an extendible and flexible notification system. Different people are interested in different kinds of notifications. Notification subscriptions allow administrators and / or users to configure the exact rules used that trigger sending of notifications.
Usage
Implementing the interface follows the standard guidelines found in
TracDev/ComponentArchitecture
and of course
TracDev/PluginDevelopment
.
The main part of this interface is the
match()
function. It returns a list of subscriptions, in the form of tuples consisting of:
class
: The name of the Python class. (This could probably be removed.)
distributor
: Also known as
transport
. E.g. the string
email
. See
INotificationDistributor
.
sid
: The session ID of the subscriber. (Can be
None
if
address
is provided.)
authenticated
:
1
for authenticated session IDs,
0
for anonymous session IDs.
address
: The (email) address to use. (Can be
None
if
sid
is provided.)
format
: The MIME type to be used (e.g.
text/plain
or
text/html
.)
priority
: An integer priority. Smaller numbers have higher priority than bigger numbers.
1
is the highest priority.
adverb
: Either the string
always
or
never
.
Since more than one component can handle the same realms and categories, the priorities and adverbs are used to resolve conflicting subscriptions.
The implementation can use any means to determine if a user is interested in hearing about a given event.
Most check that the appropriate conditions apply and then retrieve the required information from the
subscription
DB table.
The subscriptions in that table are configured in a shared preferences panel that uses two other methods of this interface:
The simple
description()
method returns a description string shown to the user in the preferences panel (or
None
if the plugin does use the
subscriptions
DB table.)
The
requires_authentication()
method allows hiding the rule from unauthenticated users. (E.g. because only authenticated users can be ticket owners.)
The
default_subscriptions()
method describes any  default subscriptions that automatically exist without the user configuring
subscription
DB entries in the preferences.
These are also displayed on the preferences panel, but can not be directly modified there. (They usually can be overriden by non-default subscriptions.)
The plugin still has to return the respective subscriptions from the
matches()
method.
Default descriptions should be used when users can be determined by the event itself.
For instance, ticket author has a default subscription that is controlled via trac.ini.
Default subscriptions should be low priority (i.e. have a priority number much larger than
1
, like 100) so that the user can easily override them.
Examples
The following example implements a simple subscriber that can trigger notifications when a new ticket is created with a high priority level.

Extension Point :
INotificationDistributor
Interface
INotificationDistributor
Since
1.1.3
Module
trac.notification
Source
api.py
​
The
INotificationDistributor
sends
notification
events over some distribution channel, like email.
Purpose
Trac provides an extendible and flexible notification system, that historically has sent notifications by email. Notifications could however also be distributed by XMPP, SMS or any other messaging protocol.
Usage
Implementing the interface follows the standard guidelines found in
TracDev/ComponentArchitecture
and of course
TracDev/PluginDevelopment
.
A simple
transports()
method lists the names of the supported transports (protocols / distribution channels). The
distribute()
method distributes a message to one or more recipients. It receives the following parameters:
transport
: The name of the transports that should be used. One of those returned by
transports()
.
recipients
: A list of
(sid, authenticated, address, format)
tuples.
sid
: The Trac session ID of the recipient (or
None
).
authenticated
:
1
if the Trac session ID is authenticated,
0
otherwise.
address
: A protocol specific address to send the notification to. If it is
None
the implementation might still be able to send the message to the recipient using the
sid
/
authenticated
information somehow. (E.g. the
EmailDistributor
falls back to
IEmailAddressResolver
implementations.)
format
: MIME type of the message format to be used.
event
: A
trac.notification.api.NotificationEvent
instance describing the event about which the recipients should be notified.
The
event
is supposed to be formatted into a message in the given
format
using a
INotificationFormatter
.
Examples
The following example distributes notifications by SMS. (The
sms
library does not exist. Several commercial SMS services provide real APIs.)

Let me start by understanding the structure and content of the provided text.\n\nThe text is about the `INotificationDistributor` interface in Trac, which is part of a notification system. It explains how notifications are distributed through different channels like email, SMS, or XMPP. The main purpose seems to be sending notifications to users based on certain events, like ticket updates.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the actions. The text mentions distributing notifications, which involves sending messages. So the actions are likely \""Use\"" since the system is using data to send these notifications. I don't see any explicit mention of collecting data here, but maybe the system is using existing data to determine where to send notifications.\n\nNext, the data types. The text refers to session IDs, addresses (like email or phone numbers), and authentication status. These fit into categories like \""Session ID\"" under \""Usage Data\"" and \""Address\"" which could be part of \""Contact Data\"". Also, authentication status might relate to \""Account Information\"".\n\nLooking at purposes, the system is primarily about sending notifications, which is functionality. It's also customizing how notifications are sent based on user preferences, so customization is another purpose. Security might come into play with authentication handling.\n\nNow, for the stories. The text describes how the system sends notifications through different channels. So a story could be about using session IDs and addresses to distribute notifications for functionality and customization.\n\nPutting it all together, the actions are \""Use\"", the data types are \""Session ID\"" and \""Address\"", the purposes are \""Functionality\"" and \""Customization\"", and the story involves using these elements to send notifications through various channels.\n</think>\n\n<Actions>Use</Actions> \n<Data Types>Session ID, Address</Data Types> \n<Purposes>Functionality, Customization</Purposes> \n<Stories>we use session id, address for functionality. we use session id, address for customization.</Stories>\n\n<R>\nThe text describes the `INotificationDistributor` interface, which is responsible for sending notifications through various channels like email, SMS, or XMPP.

This interface is part of a notification system that can send alerts through various channels like email, SMS, or XMPP. \n\nLooking at the Actions category, the main actions here are \""Use\"" and \""Share.\"" The system uses data to determine how to send notifications and shares that data through different distribution channels. I don't see any mention of collecting new data beyond what's already being used, so \""Collect\"" might not be applicable here.\n\nFor Data Types, the text mentions session IDs, addresses, and formats. Session ID falls under Account Information, specifically User ID. The address, which could be an email or phone number, relates to Contact Data. The format, like MIME type, isn't a specific data type from the provided categories, so I'll skip that.\n\nThe Purposes here are primarily Functionality and Security. The notification system's core function is to send alerts, which is functionality.

Extension Point :
INotificationDistributor
Interface
INotificationDistributor
Since
1.1.3
Module
trac.notification
Source
api.py
â€‹
The
INotificationDistributor
sends
notification
events over some distribution channel, like email.
Purpose
Trac provides an extendible and flexible notification system, that historically has sent notifications by email. Notifications could however also be distributed by XMPP, SMS or any other messaging protocol.
Usage
Implementing the interface follows the standard guidelines found in
TracDev/ComponentArchitecture
and of course
TracDev/PluginDevelopment
.
A simple
transports()
method lists the names of the supported transports (protocols / distribution channels). The
distribute()
method distributes a message to one or more recipients. It receives the following parameters:
transport
: The name of the transports that should be used. One of those returned by
transports()
.
recipients
: A list of
(sid, authenticated, address, format)
tuples.
sid
: The Trac session ID of the recipient (or
None
).
authenticated
:
1
if the Trac session ID is authenticated,
0
otherwise.
address
: A protocol specific address to send the notification to. If it is
None
the implementation might still be able to send the message to the recipient using the
sid
/
authenticated
information somehow. (E.g. the
EmailDistributor
falls back to
IEmailAddressResolver
implementations.)
format
: MIME type of the message format to be used.
event
: A
trac.notification.api.NotificationEvent
instance describing the event about which the recipients should be notified.
The
event
is supposed to be formatted into a message in the given
format
using a
INotificationFormatter
.
Examples
The following example distributes notifications by SMS. (The
sms
library does not exist. Several commercial SMS services provide real APIs.)

INotificationSubscriber
Interface
INotificationSubscriber
Since
1.1.3
Module
trac.notification
Source
api.py
​
The
INotificationSubscriber
subscribes users to
notification
events.
Purpose
Trac provides an extendible and flexible notification system. Different people are interested in different kinds of notifications. Notification subscriptions allow administrators and / or users to configure the exact rules used that trigger sending of notifications.
Usage
Implementing the interface follows the standard guidelines found in
TracDev/ComponentArchitecture
and of course
TracDev/PluginDevelopment
.
The main part of this interface is the
match()
function. It returns a list of subscriptions, in the form of tuples consisting of:
class
: The name of the Python class. (This could probably be removed.)
distributor
: Also known as
transport
. E.g. the string
email
. See
INotificationDistributor
.
sid
: The session ID of the subscriber. (Can be
None
if
address
is provided.)
authenticated
:
1
for authenticated session IDs,
0
for anonymous session IDs.
address
: The (email) address to use. (Can be
None
if
sid
is provided.)
format
: The MIME type to be used (e.g.
text/plain
or
text/html
.)
priority
: An integer priority. Smaller numbers have higher priority than bigger numbers.
1
is the highest priority.
adverb
: Either the string
always
or
never
.
Since more than one component can handle the same realms and categories, the priorities and adverbs are used to resolve conflicting subscriptions.
The implementation can use any means to determine if a user is interested in hearing about a given event.
Most check that the appropriate conditions apply and then retrieve the required information from the
subscription
DB table.
The subscriptions in that table are configured in a shared preferences panel that uses two other methods of this interface:
The simple
description()
method returns a description string shown to the user in the preferences panel (or
None
if the plugin does use the
subscriptions
DB table.)
The
requires_authentication()
method allows hiding the rule from unauthenticated users. (E.g. because only authenticated users can be ticket owners.)
The
default_subscriptions()
method describes any  default subscriptions that automatically exist without the user configuring
subscription
DB entries in the preferences.
These are also displayed on the preferences panel, but can not be directly modified there. (They usually can be overriden by non-default subscriptions.)
The plugin still has to return the respective subscriptions from the
matches()
method.
Default descriptions should be used when users can be determined by the event itself.
For instance, ticket author has a default subscription that is controlled via trac.ini.
Default subscriptions should be low priority (i.e. have a priority number much larger than
1
, like 100) so that the user can easily override them.
Examples
The following example implements a simple subscriber that can trigger notifications when a new ticket is created with a high priority level.

Open Questions
Merge
description()
and
requires_authentication()
These methods are both only used in the preferences panel.
Merging them could be easier to understand and more flexible, allowing different requirement checks:
def get_subscription_preference_description(self, req):
        if req.is_authenticated and 'TICKET_ADMIN' in req.perm:
            return ""notify me when an admin is needed""
Remove
class
name
The
class
item could be removed from the tuple returned by
matches()
. It's not really needed and clutters up each plugin with ugly
klass = self.__class__.__name__
lines.
Counter-arguments:
It helps debugging and can be logged.
But if that's needed the
NotificationSystem
should do so, to avoid mistakes and simplify plugins.
The
subscription
DB table requires that anyway.
But it should be replaced there as well, e.g. by a freely chosen
rule
string.

The user provided a detailed example, so I should follow that structure closely. \n\nFirst, I'll start by identifying the actions mentioned in the text. The text talks about implementing interfaces for notification distribution and subscription. So, actions like Collect, Use, and Share come to mind because the system is gathering data, using it to send notifications, and sharing it across different channels.\n\nNext, I'll look for data types. The text mentions session IDs, email addresses, and possibly some app interactions since it's about notifications. These fit into categories like Contact Data (email), Session ID under Usage Data, and maybe app interactions as part of Usage Data as well.\n\nNow, the purposes. The system is using these data types for functionality, security, and tracking.

The purpose here is 'Functionality' because it's about how the system operates to send these notifications.\n\nNext, the text talks about the INotificationSubscriber interface. This part is about users subscribing to notifications. The actions here would be 'Collect' because the system is gathering subscription preferences and user data. The data types involved are session IDs and user IDs, which are used to manage subscriptions. The purpose here is 'Functionality' again, but also 'Security' because managing user subscriptions securely is important.\n\nLooking at the stories, I can see two main interactions. One where the system uses session IDs and user interactions to manage subscriptions securely, and another where it collects session IDs to enable notification distribution. These stories tie together the actions, data, and purposes.\n\nI should make sure I'm only using the allowed categories and not introducing any new ones.

Direct Messaging with LibreEHR and EMR Direct phiMail(R)
Version 1.3, 19 Jul 2014

A. Purpose: To provide a secure method from within LibreEHR for sending/receiving 
protected health information to/from another Direct address using the Direct Project 
messaging standard, as a step toward the goal of satisfying the three MU2 criteria 
requiring the use of Direct messaging.  (For general information about Direct messaging, 
see http://www.emrdirect.com/about-directed-exchange-and-secure-direct-messaging.html)

B. IMPORTANT:  Please be aware of the following limitations when using the LibreEHR 
Direct Messaging features with PHI in a production environment:

1. the current code only supports a single shared ""group"" Direct Address for each LibreEHR 
installation. Note that this model is fully compliant with the Direct Project 
requirements for Direct messaging, but we may add additional models in the future 
should we determine that doing so would provide a higher degree of interoperability for 
LibreEHR users.

2. the current code only sends the CCR or CCD XML data that is already available in LibreEHR; 
these files as currently generated by existing LibreEHR code do not meet the requirements 
of the MU2 criteria, and the current CCD files do not pass strict CDA validation tests.

C. Problems Solved:

1. Patient-initiated transmission of clinical data from the Report section of the Patient 
Portal interface.

2. Provider-initiated transmission of clinical data from the Report section of the Patient 
pane in the main LibreEHR interface.

3. Log all data transmissions including date/time, patient, and whether transmission 
was initiated by the patient through the Patient Portal or by an LibreEHR user through the 
main interface.

4. Receive Direct messages from other sources.

D. How it Works:
Once configured, LibreEHR will interface with a phiMail Direct messaging server to complete the
required message transactions. The phiMail platform is described on the EMR Direct website, 
http://www.emrdirect.com and http://www.emrdirect.com/phimail-faq.html.

E. What you need before enabling Direct Messaging in LibreEHR:

1. Test Mode: Developers may request a complimentary test address at 
https://www.emrdirect.com/subscribe-developer  
Access to a sandbox server is available for testing and development purposes.

2. Production Mode: Healthcare provider users should begin by signing up for a production 
Direct messaging account with EMR Direct by registering at https://www.emrdirect.com/subscribe

Subscribers will receive the username, password, and server address information with which to 
configure LibreEHR.  

F. How to enable the Direct Messaging Features in LibreEHR:
Setup of phiMail Direct messaging Service is done in the Administration::Globals::Connectors 
tab

1. Check the ""Enable phiMail Direct Messaging Service"" checkbox.

2. Enter the Server Address, Username, and Password provided to you. The server address
will be of the form ""ssl://servername.example.com:32541"" - replace the hostname and port
with the values provided to you by EMR Direct. The Username is your Direct Address. Do not 
enter the server URL into your browser address bar, as this will not work.

3. Specify the LibreEHR user who will receive notification of new incoming Direct messages. 
Enter their LibreEHR username in the notification user field.

4. Specify the interval for automatic message checking; we suggest 5 or 10 minutes as a
starting point, but installations processing a large number of Direct messages may want a 
shorter interval. To disable automatic message checking through LibreEHR's background service
manager, set the interval to 0 (zero). Disabling automatic checking would be appropriate 
if message checking is managed through another mechanism, such as a system cron job.

5. Optionally check ""phiMail Allow CCD Send"" and/or ""phiMail Allow CCR Send"" to enable
the Transmit feature for these data types. If you do not select at least one of these,
LibreEHR will operate in a receive-only mode.

6. Click the ""Save"" button.

7. Confirm that a valid Notification Email Address is set in the Administration::
Globals::Notifications tab to receive error notifications from the Direct Messaging service.

8. Install the EMR Direct trust anchor certificate.  

Note: This is *not* your Direct certificate; it is the trust anchor for the SSL 
certificate issued to our servers, and is used only to validate the SSL certificate 
presented by the phiMail server on the other side of LibreEHR's connection.  Your Direct private
key and certificate are managed by the phiMail Server and are not installed in LibreEHR.
Your Direct certificate is made availabe for your review by EMR Direct, but you will not
need to install it anywhere.

For added security, the trust anchor for the phiMail Server should be installed in the LibreEHR 
installation tree at:

[installation_root]/sites/[site_id]/documents/phimail_server_pem/phimail_server.pem

This phimail_server_pem directory and its contents should be readable by the the 
webserver process, but only writable by trusted local users. The certificate file 
itself must be PEM encoded. You can identify a PEM encoded certificate file because 
it begins with the text ""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"". Although LibreEHR will connect 
to phiMail servers without installing this certificate, this is a required configuration 
step for all production  accounts to ensure that you are connecting to the correct 
server. You can obtain the correct certificate at the following URLs:

  a. Test accounts: http://certs.emrdirect.com/EMRDirectTestCA.crt
     Important: Don't forget to rename the file to phimail_server.pem and install it
     in the correct directory.

  b. Production accounts: https://www.phicert.com/certs/phiCertDirectRootCA.crt
     Important: The production root must be converted to PEM format as follows:
     $ openssl x509 -in phiCertDirectRootCA.crt -inform DER -out phimail_server.pem
     Don't forget to install phimail_server.pem in the correct directory. As an added
     security measure, please call us to confirm the thumbprint on this certificate.

G. Debugging background connections to the server.

You may review the connection activity to the server by Selecting Administration::Other::Logs,
selecting ""direct-message"" in the ""Name of events:"" drop-down menu, and clicking ""[Refresh]"".
If the background service is succesfully connecting, you will see ""message check completed""
events in the log as well as any message related entries (see below for instructions to
view more detailed message related status information). If you see no entries, make sure that
the background service is enabled (See F.4 above). If you see ""could not connect to server""
entries, each entry will also contain an error code:

  C1: phiMail is disabled in the global configuration. Fix: enable.
  C2: the phiMail server URL entered in the global configuration is invalid. Fix: Confirm
      the URL has been entered correctly. It should be of the form 
      ""ssl://server.example.com:32541"".
  C3: unable to create stream context. Fix: Usually this is because the server certificate 
      file installed in F.8 above is not the correct certificate or is in the wrong format.
  C4: failed to open connection. Fix: Confirm you Internet service and local DNS servers are
      online and your firewall is not blocking connections to the phiMail Server.

H. Checking the status and history of the Direct Messaging Service in LibreEHR:
Administrators may view the status of the service by Selecting Reports::Services::Background 
Services from the main LibreEHR left navigation bar. The ""View Log"" link on this page or 
Reports::Services::Direct Message Log will open the messaging history log showing each message 
sent or received and the current status of that message (Received, Sent, Delivery Confirmed, 
or Failed).

I. Note of message status messages: Receiving message status updates requires that Direct message
checking be enabled. When receiving messages, the phiMail back-end is fully compliant with the 
Direct messaging protocols to notify the sender and provide final delivery confirmation, but 
please note that  many other Direct providers do not yet support these features. If a message 
is sent to a recipient using one of these other systems, LibreEHR probably won't ever receive a 
final delivery confirmation for that message.

J. How to use the Direct Messaging Features in LibreEHR:

1. Sending:
When the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, an additional ""Transmit"" button will
appear in the Continuity of Care Record (CCR) and/or Continuity of Care Document (CCD) block 
of the Reports section in both the Patient Portal and the Patient pane of the main provider 
interface. 

To transmit a CCR or CCD, first click the ""Transmit"" button. This will open a small dialog 
immediately below the button with a form field to enter the intended recipient's Direct Address. 
Clicking ""Transmit"" again will hide the dialog.

A Direct Address should have the same form as a regular email address, e.g. 
jonesclinic@direct.example.com. Enter the address in the field and click the ""Send"" button 
immediately to the right of the field. Only a single recipient may be specified in the field.
The Send button will be temporarily disabled while LibreEHR is communicating with the phiMail 
server. This will only work for properly-configured Direct addresses. Attempts to send to a 
regular email address or Direct address outside of our test mode ""trust sandbox"" will fail
during testing. Production accounts have wide interoperability with other Direct service
providers. Should you encounter a trust community with which LibreEHR does not interoperate,
please let us know at support@emrdirect.com.

LibreEHR will then display a status message immediately below the Address field, the 
success or failure of the message transmission, or an error message. If the message is
successfully submitted to the server, the Address field will be cleared to prevent accidental
re-transmission. If multiple recipients are required, the next recipient can now be entered.

If you receive an error message, it will be followed by an error code. For a discussion
of error codes beginning with the letter ""C"" please see section G above. Error codes
beginning with ""EC"" are listed here:

  EC 1: phiMail disabled in global configuration. Fix: enable.
  EC 4: authentication failure. Fix: The Username and Password entered in the
        global configuration must be corrected.
  EC 5: request to add text failed. Fix: Confirm total message length < 5MB.
  EC 6: problem sending the text. Fix: Confirm your local network connectivity is stable.
  EC 7: request to add clinical document failed. Fix: see EC 5.
  EC 8: problem sending the clinical document. Fix: see EC 6.

2. Receiving:
When the phiMail Direct Messaging service is enabled, and message checking is enabled either 
through the background services manager of another mechanism, LibreEHR will automatically process 
message status updates and new messages. Status updates will be reflected immediately in the 
Direct Messaging log. Additionally, if a ""Failed"" notification is received for a previously sent 
message, a regular email message will be generated to the Notification Email Address specified 
in the Notifications tab of the Global Settings panel (accessed by selecting Administration::
Globals from the main left navigation menu).

New Direct messages will be processed as follows. A new ""Patient Note"" will be generated and 
sent to the phiMail notification user specified in the Connectors tab of the Global settings. 
The patient note will contain information about the message, including any text at the beginning 
of the message from the sender. Any attachments (and any non-text content) will be automatically 
converted to separate LibreEHR Documents, which will be referenced in the new Patient Note.  
The Documents and the Patient Note are initially created without an assigned patient. 

At this time, the envisioned workflow is that the notification user will review the message text
and any included Documents to determine which patient the content belongs to and will then set the 
patient using the existing Patient Note interface for choosing a patient. Once the patient is sent, 
the Patient Note can be forwarded to another provider or staff member as appropriate using the 
existing forwarding mechanism for Patient Notes. The unassigned Documents can be viewed by Selecting 
Miscellaneous::New Documents from the main left navigation menu, which opens a Documents list. Once 
the specified document is opened, the user can optionally categorize the document and, when 
appropriate, assign the document to a specific patient using the ""Move to Patient #"" feature in the 
Documents interface.

Zulip's default EmailAuthBackend authenticates users by verifying control over their email address, and then allowing them to set a password for their account. There are two development environment details worth understanding:

All of our authentication flows in the development environment have special links to the /emails page (advertised in /devtools), which shows all emails that the Zulip server has ""sent"" (emails are not actually sent by the development environment), to make it convenient to click through the UI of signup, password reset, etc.
There's a management command, manage.py print_initial_password username@example.com, that prints out default passwords for the development environment users. Note that if you change a user's password in the development environment, those passwords will no longer work. It also prints out the user's current API key.

Security and privacy
Use of the push notification bouncer is subject to the Zulip Cloud Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Rules of Use. By using push notifications, you agree to these terms.

We've designed this push notification bouncer service with security and privacy in mind:

A central design goal of the Push Notification Service is to avoid any message content being stored or logged by the service, even in error cases.

The Push Notification Service only stores the necessary metadata for delivering the notifications to the appropriate devices and otherwise operating the service:

The APNS/FCM tokens needed to securely send mobile push notifications to iOS and Android devices, one per device registered to be notified by your Zulip server.
User ID numbers generated by your Zulip server, needed to route a given notification to the appropriate set of mobile devices. These user ID numbers are opaque to the Push Notification Service and Kandra Labs.
Basic organization metadata, optional usage statistics, and aggregate statistics about how many push notifications are sent by each customer.
The Push Notification Service receives (but does not store) the contents of individual mobile push notifications:

The numeric message ID generated by your Zulip server.
Metadata on the message's sender (name and avatar URL).
Metadata on the message's recipient (channel name + ID, topic, direct message recipients, etc.).
A timestamp.
The message's content.
There's a PUSH_NOTIFICATION_REDACT_CONTENT setting available to disable any message content being sent via the push notification bouncer (i.e., message content will be replaced with New message). Note that this setting makes push notifications significantly less usable.

We plan to replace that setting with end-to-end encryption which would eliminate that usability tradeoff and additionally allow us to not have any access to the other details mentioned in this section.

All of the network requests (both from Zulip servers to the Push Notification Service and from the Push Notification Service to the relevant Google and Apple services) are encrypted over the wire with SSL/TLS.

The code for the push notification forwarding service is 100% open source and available as part of the Zulip server project on GitHub (specifically, here).

The push notification forwarding servers are professionally managed by a small team of security-sensitive engineers.

If you have any questions about the security model, contact Zulip support.

Uploading basic metadata
All Zulip installations running Zulip 8.0 or greater that are registered for the Mobile Push Notification Service regularly upload to the service basic metadata about the organizations hosted by the installation. (Older Zulip servers upload these metadata only if uploading usage statistics is enabled).

Uploaded metadata consists of, for each organization hosted by the installation:

A subset of the basic metadata returned by the unauthenticated GET /server_settings API endpoint.

The purpose of that API endpoint is to serve the minimal data needed by the Zulip mobile apps in order to:

Verify that a given URL is indeed a valid Zulip server URL
Present a correct login form, offering only the supported features and authentication methods for that organization and Zulip server version.
Most of the metadata it returns is necessarily displayed to anyone with network access to the Zulip server on the login and signup pages for your Zulip organization as well.

(Some fields returned by this endpoint, like the organization icon and description, are not included in uploaded metadata.)

The organization type and creation date.

The number of user accounts with each role.

Our use of uploaded metadata is governed by the same Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that covers the Mobile Push Notification Service itself.

Uploading usage statistics
By default, Zulip installations that register for the Mobile Push Notification Service upload the following usage statistics. You can disable these uploads any time by setting ZULIP_SERVICE_SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS=False in /etc/zulip/settings.py.

Totals for messages sent and read with subtotals for various combinations of clients and integrations.
Totals for active users under a few definitions (1day, 7day, 15day) and related statistics.
Some of the graphs on your server's usage statistics page can be generated from these statistics.

When enabled, usage statistics are submitted via an hourly cron job. If you'd like to access plan management immediately after enabling SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS=True (the legacy form of this setting) on a pre-8.0 Zulip server, you can run the analytics job manually via:

/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py update_analytics_counts
Our use of uploaded usage statistics is governed by the same Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that covers the Mobile Push Notification Service itself.

Rate limits
The Mobile Push Notification Service API has a very high default rate limit of 1000 requests per minute. A Zulip server makes requests to this API every time it sends a push notification, which is fairly frequent, but we believe it to be unlikely that a self-hosted installation will hit this limit.

This limit is primarily intended to protect the service against DoS attacks (intentional or otherwise). If you hit this limit or you anticipate that your server will require sending more push notifications than the limit permits, please contact support.

Updating your server's registration
Your server's registration includes the server's hostname and contact email address (from EXTERNAL_HOST and ZULIP_ADMINISTRATOR in /etc/zulip/settings.py, aka the --hostname and --email options in the installer). You can update your server's registration data by running manage.py register_server again.

If you'd like to rotate your server's API key for this service (zulip_org_key), you need to use manage.py register_server --rotate-key option; it will automatically generate a new zulip_org_key and store that new key in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf.

Deactivating your server's registration
If you are deleting your Zulip server or otherwise no longer want to use the Mobile Push Notification Service, you can deactivate your server's registration.

Cancel any paid plans associated with your server.

Run the deregistration command. If you installed Zulip directly on the server (without Docker), run as root:

su zulip -c '/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py register_server --deactivate'
Or if you're using Docker, run:

docker exec -it -u zulip <container_name> /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py register_server --deactivate
Comment out the ZULIP_SERVICE_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS = True line in your /etc/zulip/settings.py file (i.e., add #  at the start of the line), and restart your Zulip server.

If you ever need to reactivate your server's registration, contact Zulip support.

Pausing use of the Mobile Push Notification Service
You can temporarily stop using the Mobile Push Notification Service. Comment out the PUSH_NOTIFICATION_BOUNCER_URL = 'https://push.zulipchat.com' line in your /etc/zulip/settings.py file (i.e., add #  at the start of the line), and restart your Zulip server. This approach makes it easy to start using the service again by uncommenting the same line.

Sending push notifications directly from your server
This section documents an alternative way to send push notifications that does not involve using the Mobile Push Notification Service at the cost of needing to compile and distribute modified versions of the Zulip mobile apps.

We don't recommend this path -- patching and shipping a production mobile app can take dozens of hours to set up even for an experienced developer, and even more time to maintain. And it doesn't provide material privacy benefits -- your organization's push notification data would still go through Apple/Google's servers, just not Kandra Labs'. But in the interest of transparency, we document in this section roughly what's involved in doing so.

As discussed above, it is impossible for a single app in the Google or Apple store to receive push notifications from multiple, mutually untrusted, servers. The Mobile Push Notification Service is one of the possible solutions to this problem.

The other possible solution is for an individual Zulip server's administrators to build and distribute their own copy of the Zulip mobile apps, hardcoding a key that they possess. This solution is possible with Zulip, but it requires the server administrators to publish their own copies of the Zulip mobile apps. There's nothing the Zulip team can do to eliminate this onerous requirement.

The main work is thus distributing your own copies of the Zulip mobile apps configured to use APNS/FCM keys that you generate. This is not for the faint of heart! If you haven't done this before, be warned that one can easily spend hundreds of dollars (on things like a DUNS number registration) and a week struggling through the hoops Apple requires to build and distribute an app through the Apple app store, even if you're making no code modifications to an app already present in the store (as would be the case here). The Zulip mobile app also gets frequent updates that you will have to either forgo or republish to the app stores yourself.

If you've done that work, the Zulip server configuration for sending push notifications through the new app is quite straightforward:

Create an FCM push notifications key in the Google Developer console and set android_gcm_api_key in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf to that key.

In Apple's developer console, register a token or certificate for sending push notifications. Then in /etc/zulip/settings.py, set APNS_SANDBOX=False, and:

If using APNs certificate-based authentication, set APNS_CERT_FILE to the path of your APNs certificate file.

If using APNs token-based authentication, set APNS_TOKEN_KEY_FILE to the path of your APNs token key file, APNS_TOKEN_KEY_ID to the corresponding 10-character key ID, and APNS_TEAM_ID to your 10-character Apple team ID.

Restart the Zulip server.

(Older Zulip servers upload these metadata only if uploading usage statistics is enabled).\n\nUploaded metadata consists of, for each organization hosted by the installation:\n\nA subset of the basic metadata returned by the unauthenticated GET /server_settings API endpoint.\n\nThe purpose of that API endpoint is to serve the minimal data needed by the Zulip mobile apps in order to:\n\nVerify that a given URL is indeed a valid Zulip server URL\nPresent a correct login form, offering only the supported features and authentication methods for that organization and Zulip server version.\nMost of the metadata it returns is necessarily displayed to anyone with network access to the Zulip server on the login and signup pages for your Zulip organization as well.\n\n(Some fields returned by this endpoint, like the organization icon and description, are not included in uploaded metadata.)\n\nThe organization type and creation date.\n\nThe number of user accounts with each role.\n\nOur use of uploaded metadata is governed by the same Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that covers the Mobile Push Notification Service itself.\n\nUploading usage statistics\nBy default, Zulip installations that register for the Mobile Push Notification Service upload the following usage statistics. You can disable these uploads any time by setting ZULIP_SERVICE_SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS=False in /etc/zulip/settings.py.\n\nTotals for messages sent and read with subtotals for various combinations of clients and integrations.\nTotals for active users under a few definitions (1day, 7day, 15day) and related statistics.\nSome of the graphs on your server's usage statistics page can be generated from these statistics.\n\nWhen enabled, usage statistics are submitted via an hourly cron job. If you'd like to access plan management immediately after enabling SUBMIT_USAGE_STATISTICS=True (the legacy form of this setting) on a pre-8.0 Zulip server, you can run the analytics job manually via:\n\n/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py update_analytics_counts\nOur use of uploaded usage statistics is governed by the same Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that covers the Mobile Push Notification Service itself.\n\nRate limits\nThe Mobile Push Notification Service API has a very high default rate limit of 1000 requests per minute. A Zulip server makes requests to this API every time it sends a push notification, which is fairly frequent, but we believe it to be unlikely that a self-hosted installation will hit this limit.\n\nThis limit is primarily intended to protect the service against DoS attacks (intentional or otherwise). If you hit this limit or you anticipate that your server will require sending more push notifications than the limit permits, please contact support.\n\nUpdating your server's registration\nYour server's registration includes the server's hostname and contact email address (from EXTERNAL_HOST and ZULIP_ADMINISTRATOR in /etc/zulip/settings.py, aka the --hostname and --email options in the installer). You can update your server's registration data by running manage.py register_server again.\n\nIf you'd like to rotate your server's API key for this service (zulip_org_key), you need to use manage.py register_server --rotate-key option; it will automatically generate a new zulip_org_key and store that new key in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf.\n\nDeactivating your server's registration\nIf you are deleting your Zulip server or otherwise no longer want to use the Mobile Push Notification Service, you can deactivate your server's registration.\n\nCancel any paid plans associated with your server.\n\nRun the deregistration command. If you installed Zulip directly on the server (without Docker), run as root:\n\nsu zulip -c '/home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py register_server --deactivate'\nOr if you're using Docker, run:\n\ndocker exec -it -u zulip <container_name> /home/zulip/deployments/current/manage.py register_server --deactivate\nComment out the ZULIP_SERVICE_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS = True line in your /etc/zulip/settings.py file (i.e., add #  at the start of the line), and restart your Zulip server.\n\nIf you ever need to reactivate your server's registration, contact Zulip support.\n\nPausing use of the Mobile Push Notification Service\nYou can temporarily stop using the Mobile Push Notification Service. Comment out the PUSH_NOTIFICATION_BOUNCER_URL = 'https://push.zulipchat.com' line in your /etc/zulip/settings.py file (i.e., add #  at the start of the line), and restart your Zulip server. This approach makes it easy to start using the service again by uncommenting the same line.\n\nSending push notifications directly from your server\nThis section documents an alternative way to send push notifications that does not involve using the Mobile Push Notification Service at the cost of needing to compile and distribute modified versions of the Zulip mobile apps.\n\nWe don't recommend this path -- patching and shipping a production mobile app can take dozens of hours to set up even for an experienced developer, and even more time to maintain. And it doesn't provide material privacy benefits -- your organization's push notification data would still go through Apple/Google's servers, just not Kandra Labs'. But in the interest of transparency, we document in this section roughly what's involved in doing so.\n\nAs discussed above, it is impossible for a single app in the Google or Apple store to receive push notifications from multiple, mutually untrusted, servers. The Mobile Push Notification Service is one of the possible solutions to this problem.\n\nThe other possible solution is for an individual Zulip server's administrators to build and distribute their own copy of the Zulip mobile apps, hardcoding a key that they possess. This solution is possible with Zulip, but it requires the server administrators to publish their own copies of the Zulip mobile apps. There's nothing the Zulip team can do to eliminate this onerous requirement.\n\nThe main work is thus distributing your own copies of the Zulip mobile apps configured to use APNS/FCM keys that you generate. This is not for the faint of heart! If you haven't done this before, be warned that one can easily spend hundreds of dollars (on things like a DUNS number registration) and a week struggling through the hoops Apple requires to build and distribute an app through the Apple app store, even if you're making no code modifications to an app already present in the store (as would be the case here). The Zulip mobile app also gets frequent updates that you will have to either forgo or republish to the app stores yourself.\n\nIf you've done that work, the Zulip server configuration for sending push notifications through the new app is quite straightforward:\n\nCreate an FCM push notifications key in the Google Developer console and set android_gcm_api_key in /etc/zulip/zulip-secrets.conf to that key.\n\nIn Apple's developer console, register a token or certificate for sending push notifications. Then in /etc/zulip/settings.py, set APNS_SANDBOX=False, and:\n\nIf using APNs certificate-based authentication, set APNS_CERT_FILE to the path of your APNs certificate file.\n\nIf using APNs token-based authentication, set APNS_TOKEN_KEY_FILE to the path of your APNs token key file, APNS_TOKEN_KEY_ID to the corresponding 10-character key ID, and APNS_TEAM_ID to your 10-character Apple team ID.\n\nRestart the Zulip server.\n\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n  \n=======\n \n\n\n>>>>>>> 1fb6e403a0661573c989bacdd4d97d2aeca26219"", ""metadata"": {""actions"": [""collect,use "", ""collect,use ""], ""data_types"": [""usage data"", ""usage data""], ""purposes"": [""tracking, security"", ""tracking, security""], ""stories"": [""We collect and use usage data for tracking and security"", ""We collect usage data for security.
